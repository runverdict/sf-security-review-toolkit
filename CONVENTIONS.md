# Authoring Conventions — sf-security-review-toolkit

Binding rules for every file in this repo. They exist so the toolkit stays honest,
generic, and current. Contributions that violate the honesty or genericization
rules get rejected regardless of quality.

## 1. What this toolkit is (and is not)

It **prepares** an ISV partner's AppExchange/AgentExchange security review
submission: it audits the partner's own codebase, generates the required artifacts,
orchestrates the required scans, and walks the human through the steps no tool can
do. It does **not** pass the review, replace the reviewers' own pen test, or
certify anything. Every skill, template, and report must preserve that distinction.

## 2. Honesty guardrails (non-negotiable)

- Never mark a scan, test, or certification complete without an evidence file the
  skill actually verified (report output, SSL Labs JSON, screenshot path).
- Every generated artifact distinguishes **automated** (what an agent did, from
  what inputs) vs **owner-run** (what the human did or must do).
- Every skill run ends with an **"Automated vs. manual recap"** section.
- The readiness verdict must list what was NOT verified, with the explicit caveat
  that Salesforce performs its own penetration testing regardless of submitted
  evidence.
- White-box agent audits are described as static/code review — never as DAST or a
  pen test.

## 3. Genericization (public-repo hygiene)

- No partner-specific endpoints, org IDs, credentials, file paths, internal
  hostnames, or company-identifying detail. Field-tested patterns appear
  anonymized ("a FastAPI backend with Postgres row-level security", "a thin 2GP
  registration package").
- No partner-gated identifiers: no Trialforce Template IDs, no W-numbers
  (Salesforce work items), no verbatim text from login-gated docs. Cite them the
  way the sibling MCP toolkit does: "the MCP Client Partner Technical Guide
  (login-gated; ask in the Partnerblazer Slack MCP channel or via your Partner
  Account Manager)."
- The Salesforce partner Slack is referenced as a *place to ask*, never quoted.

## 4. Baseline-as-data (currency model)

All requirement facts live in `baseline/requirements-baseline.yaml` — never
hard-coded in skill prose. Each entry carries:

```yaml
- id: dast-scope-includes-identity-endpoints   # stable kebab id
  requirement: ...                   # one sentence
  details: ...                       # thresholds, formats, exact expectations
  applies_to: [managed-package | external-endpoint | mcp-server | canvas | both | all]
  automation: fully | partially | manual_only
  automation_notes: ...
  severity_if_missing: blocker | major | minor | informational
  sources:
    - url: ...
      date: ...                      # publication/updated date or "unknown"
      kind: official | community | partner_gated | empirical
  verification: verified_primary | web_research_unverified | conflicting
  last_verified: YYYY-MM-DD | null
  conflicts: ...                     # only when verification: conflicting
```

Rules:
- Skills MUST read the baseline at run time and warn when `last_verified` on the
  entries they use is older than **90 days** (the review process changed three
  times in 18 months: Chimera retirement, Code Analyzer v5, AgentExchange).
- `conflicting` entries are surfaced to the user as "verify with your Partner
  Account Manager / partner Slack before relying on this" — never silently picked.
- `partner_gated` sources are cited by name only (see §3).
- `baseline/SOURCES.md` is the registry: every source URL once, with what it
  corroborates and when it was last checked.

## 5. Skill structure (mirrors sf-mcp-partner-toolkit)

- Frontmatter: `name`, `description` (when to use it, in one breath),
  `allowed-tools` (narrowest workable set).
- Body sections in order: title · one-paragraph promise · **When to use** (with
  NOT-for bullets) · **Prerequisites** · numbered **Steps** · **Automated vs.
  manual recap** · **What feeds the next skill**.
- Steps encode *failure modes*, not happy paths — every "why" that cost someone a
  review cycle gets a sentence.
- Skills are self-contained: never assume another skill ran first; detect state
  and degrade. Cross-references use the installed form
  `/sf-security-review-toolkit:<skill>`.
- Shared assets are referenced as `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/baseline/...`,
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/methodology/...`, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/...`,
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/harness/...`.
- Multi-agent work: prefer the Workflow tool when available; every workflow has a
  documented sequential fallback using plain subagent (Task/Agent) calls.
- Declare token-cost expectations up front for anything that fans out agents
  (`quick` / `standard` / `exhaustive` tiers with approximate agent counts).

## 6. Target-repo state model

Skills write into the PARTNER's repo, never into the plugin:

- `<target>/docs/security-review/` — generated artifacts (committed, reviewable).
- `<target>/.security-review/` — machine state: `scope-manifest.json`,
  `audit-ledger.json`, `evidence/` (scan outputs, SSL Labs JSON, screenshots),
  `run-log.md`, `runs/run-<k>/audit-ledger.json` (per-run ledger snapshots for the
  cross-run stability read, audit-codebase step 9), and
  `recurrence-confidence.json` (the deterministic recurrence-confidence artifact).
  Recommend the partner commits this too (the ledger is what makes re-audits
  incremental), excluding any credential material.
- Nothing in state files may contain secrets; skills must refuse to write captured
  credentials and say where to put them instead (env vars, vaults).

## 7. Audit engine rules

- The find → **adversarial-verify** → synthesize loop is mandatory. Findings that
  skip verification are never shown as findings.
- Precision over volume: a finding requires exact file:line, a concrete
  `exploit_scenario` (attacker, request, impact), and survives a skeptical
  verifier who read the gating code. Correct controls are not findings.
- Severity taxonomy: `critical` (auto-fail / cross-tenant / key compromise),
  `high` (must fix before submission), `medium` (likely flagged; should fix),
  `low` (hardening), `info`. Verifiers emit `adjusted_severity`.
- The known-findings ledger (`audit-ledger.json`) carries every confirmed,
  refuted, fixed, and accepted-risk finding across runs; finder prompts embed
  the ledger as "do NOT re-report" context. This is what makes pass N+1 cheap
  and quiet.
- Dimensions are concept-stable, target-variable: each dimension file defines the
  threat concept, what "good" looks like, and **detection heuristics** for
  locating the relevant code per stack (the stack-adapter step resolves real
  paths before finders run).
- **Determinizable honesty claims are engine-backed, not narrated (0.5.0).** Any
  self-describing count, applicability set, readiness band/gate, finding de-dup,
  or staleness check MUST be computed by a pure `harness/*.mjs` engine — no LLM,
  no network, no dependencies, byte-identical on re-run — and guarded by a
  self-asserting `acceptance/test-*.mjs` standing test that fails the build if the
  property breaks. A rule that exists only as skill prose is only as strong as the
  model that remembers to invoke it (a cold-start run proved this twice: the
  AuthN/AuthZ-withhold gate, when it lived in journey narration, was improvised
  past on a resume path). The enforced form lives in `harness/artifact-gate.mjs`,
  `applicable-requirements.mjs`, `baseline-counts.mjs`, `finding-clusters.mjs`,
  `ledger-staleness.mjs`, `injection-check.mjs`, `package-readiness.mjs`,
  `compute-sci.mjs`, `recurrence-confidence.mjs` (cross-run recurrence
  classification over N ledgers — the variance is engine-classified, never
  narrated), and the per-run engines that replaced LLM-authored
  scripts — `build-audit-engine.mjs` (extract + inject the audit run-args),
  `build-artifact-engine.mjs` (the 0.8.21 P2-PARITY twin for the ARTIFACT phase:
  inject the artifact-drafting DATA into `artifact-workflow-template.mjs`, the same
  shipped-template-plus-injected-DATA pattern, so neither phase hand-authors a
  Workflow with inline prompt strings — the JS-escaping/parse-error class is gone
  from BOTH phases now),
  `merge-ledger.mjs` (mechanical ledger merge), and `build-evidence-index.mjs`
  (the evidence index + the reviewer-reproducible credit rule). The credit rule
  is the load-bearing one: SATISFIED requires reviewer-reproducible evidence;
  an audit-only clear is `statically-cleared` and never moves the headline (the
  toolkit must not grade its own exam). Prose-only fixes are permitted
  but must be labelled NOT-test-backed in the CHANGELOG (same residual class), and
  a high-stakes prose layer is a candidate for promotion to an engine + a
  PreToolUse hook (runtime-independent enforcement).
- **Operator-facing GATES are pinned by an engine, rendered VERBATIM by the driver
  (0.8.22).** The `AskUserQuestion` gate option sets were driver-improvised prose, and a
  cold campaign caught the drift (the same depth gate offered a different option set
  run-to-run). The fix applies the repo's contract — the ENGINE owns structure, the driver
  supplies data — to the gate class. `harness/gate-spec.mjs` is a FROZEN catalog keyed by
  gate id + a PURE `gateOptions(gateId, facts)` selector that returns
  `{gate, consent, header, question, options:[{label, description, decision}]}`. It mirrors
  `build-audit-engine`'s `ALWAYS_ON` (the decline/skip option is FORCE-INJECTED on every
  consent gate, so a caller cannot drop it), `build-artifact-engine`'s `FOCUS_MIN` THROW
  (FAIL CLOSED on an unknown gate id or any option missing `label`/`description`/`decision`,
  or a decision that is not a valid `record-consent` token — exactly `affirm`/`deny`), and
  `applicable-requirements`'s pure set-operation style (no LLM/network; the CLI's `--target`
  ledger read is the only FS touch). **The render-verbatim-gate contract:** the driver lists
  `gate-spec.mjs` in `allowed-tools`, calls it, renders each option's `label`/`description`
  VERBATIM (never paraphrases, reorders, or invents the option set), and pipes ONLY the
  chosen option's `decision` token to `record-consent.mjs --decision`. The engine owns the
  option set upstream; `record-consent` pins the decision downstream; the driver improvises
  neither. No silent behavior change — gate-spec only fixes WHICH options appear and their
  wording; the consent semantics (`record-consent` token, `build-audit-engine` fail-closed
  verify) are unchanged. **Slice 5 (0.8.27)** extends the catalog to the scope-submission gates
  (`mcp-probe`, `scope-confirm`, the `partner-program` six-gate family, `clarify-detection`,
  `listing-type`, `tenancy`) and adds a `kind` taxonomy (`consent | election | answer`,
  load-validated as `consent ⟺ kind:'consent'`) encoding TWO semantic classes: a CONSENT-to-act
  gate force-injects the decline and pipes its `decision` to `record-consent`; an ANSWER gate's
  selected option is RECORDED into the scope manifest (no force-injected decline, not piped).
  Guarded by `test-gate-spec.mjs` + `test-tier-no-reask.mjs` + `test-scope-gates.mjs`.
- **Operator-facing OUTPUT is pinned by render harnesses + `{{SLOT}}` templates,
  rendered VERBATIM by the driver (0.8.23–0.8.24).** The gate-spec rule's twin for the OUTPUT
  class — the readiness verdict / status / target-map renders were driver-improvised
  (a table one run, prose the next; reordered sections; a re-worded standing caveat).
  Two mechanisms, both ENGINE-owns-skeleton / driver-supplies-data:
  (1) **Render harnesses** extend a deterministic-JSON emitter with a fixed-block mode
  the way `compute-sci.mjs` does — `harness/render-stability.mjs` emits the verbatim
  Finding-Stability block from `recurrence-confidence.json` (0.8.23). Slice 3 (0.8.24,
  WI-04/WI-05) adds the entry-experience siblings: `render-target-map.mjs` (the approval
  table), `render-preflight.mjs` (the 3-tier report with the FIXED 4-state deployed-org
  enum), `render-scan-status.mjs` (the 8-row Family table), `render-router-status.mjs`
  (the 3-line "where are we?"), `render-recap.mjs` (the end-of-run recap, emitted by
  `merge-ledger.mjs`), and `finding-clusters.mjs --headline` (the triage headline — the
  FAILURE VERDICT, byte-identical at the audit exec summary AND the journey blocker gate).
  (2) **`templates/operator/*.md.tmpl`** `{{SLOT}}` skeletons with fixed `##` section
  order, each engine block wrapped in `<!-- RENDER:… -->` sentinels — filled by
  `harness/render-readiness-verdict.mjs`, which force-injects the SINGLE canonical
  `STANDING_CAVEAT` constant (so source and output can't diverge) and FAILS CLOSED on
  any unfilled `{{SLOT}}` (the "not submission-ready" lint, promoted from skill prose to
  an engine — mirrors `build-artifact-engine`'s missing-template throw).
  **The render-verbatim-output contract:** each pinned surface's skill (a) lists the
  render harness / template in `allowed-tools`, (b) carries "print the harness stdout /
  fill the `.tmpl` VERBATIM — never paraphrase, reorder, drop a column, or flip
  table↔prose", and (c) pastes deterministic blocks (the SCI block, the stability block)
  byte-for-byte. Policed by `lintRenderVerbatim` (`render-readiness-verdict.mjs`), which
  flags a skill that hand-builds a Markdown table for a surface that has a registered
  renderer/template. Guarded by `test-render-stability.mjs` + `test-readiness-verdict.mjs`
  + the Slice-3 tests (`test-finding-clusters-headline`, `test-render-target-map`,
  `test-render-preflight`, `test-render-scan-status`, `test-render-router-status`,
  `test-render-recap`) + the Slice-4 scope-submission REPORT renders (0.8.25, WI-06 reports
  half: `render-detected-elements.mjs` INV-15, `applicable-requirements.mjs --render` INV-16,
  `render-mcp-scope.mjs` INV-43+44 — the MCP renders never present an un-probed fact as probed —
  and `render-sf-autoresolve.mjs` INV-45 — which SURFACES every security flag + operator-answer
  conflict and NEVER renders a secret), guarded by `test-render-detected-elements`,
  `test-render-mcp-scope`, `test-render-sf-autoresolve`, and the extended
  `test-applicable-requirements`; each asserting determinism + a golden snapshot + fail-safe + the
  skill-wiring (grants + references + "print verbatim"). The Slice-5 final scope-summary
  (0.8.27, WI-06/INV-06: `render-scope-summary.mjs` — the fixed Step-9 readout whose
  operatorConfirmed gate states render HONESTLY (✓/✗/not-recorded, never a fabricated ✓) and whose
  missing-manifest branch renders "scope not finalized", never a fabricated "ready") is guarded by
  `test-render-scope-summary.mjs`.
- **Irreversible sf/host ops are consent-gated, fail-closed (0.8.11).** The
  deployed-package deep-audit skills run live, irreversible Salesforce / host ops
  (`sf package version promote` — a PERMANENT release — plus package install/uninstall,
  scratch-org create/delete, `sf data delete`, destructive deploy, `sf org login`,
  `npm install -g`) as prose-only Bash. Three consent gates back them —
  `sf-package-promote` (its own, for the permanent release), `sf-deep-audit-ops`, and
  `sf-cli-setup` — recorded via `harness/record-consent.mjs` under
  `.security-review/consent/`. The shipped PreToolUse hook `hooks/sf-ops-gate-hook.mjs`
  (matcher `Bash`) classifies the command on its ACTION VERB and **DENIES** a gated op,
  inside a managed audit repo, unless an affirmative consent is recorded — so a skipped
  ask cannot run the op. Scoped to a `.security-review/` tree (never blocks arbitrary
  Bash) and verb-based (read-only verbs always pass). Honest residual: a deliberately
  obfuscated op can still evade the classifier — the same limit the consent belt
  documents (see `docs/sf-ops-safety-gate.md`).
- **The ONE network-touching engine is `install-scanners.mjs`, and it is split to
  keep the no-network rule intact (0.6.0).** Every other `harness/*.mjs` is pure,
  no-network, byte-identical. `install-scanners.mjs` installs missing scan tools, so
  its EXECUTOR must reach the network — the documented exception. It is split so the
  honesty model still holds: `planInstalls()` is the PURE, byte-identical, test-backed
  half (the plan — per-tool dir, literal commands, pinned URL+sha256, PATH-prepend);
  `installScanners()` is the impure executor and **fails closed without explicit
  `consent` at the engine boundary** (a network install is the 0.5.4 P0 class —
  silence-is-yes never covers it, and the gate is re-asserted in code so a forgetful
  caller still cannot install). Raw binary downloads are **sha256-verified against an
  author-pinned checksum before the file is ever made executable or extracted**; no pin
  ⇒ skipped → PENDING-OWNER-RUN, never run unverified. Bumping a pinned tool means
  re-pinning the version AND every per-platform sha256 from the release's published
  checksums. `cleanup-scanners.mjs` (the asymmetric remover) is manifest-driven and
  likewise reads/removes only what the executor recorded.
