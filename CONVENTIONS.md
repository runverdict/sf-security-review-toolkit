# Authoring Conventions — sf-security-review-toolkit

Binding rules for every file in this repo. They exist so the toolkit stays honest,
generic, and current. Contributions that violate the honesty or genericization
rules get rejected regardless of quality.

## 1. What this toolkit is (and is not)

It **prepares** an ISV partner's AppExchange/AgentExchange security review
submission: it audits the partner's own codebase, generates the required artifacts,
orchestrates the required scans, and walks the human through the steps no tool can
do. It does **not** pass the review, replace the reviewers' own pen test, or
certify anything. Every skill, template, and report must preserve that distinction.

## 2. Honesty guardrails (non-negotiable)

- Never mark a scan, test, or certification complete without an evidence file the
  skill actually verified (report output, SSL Labs JSON, screenshot path).
- Every generated artifact distinguishes **automated** (what an agent did, from
  what inputs) vs **owner-run** (what the human did or must do).
- Every skill run ends with an **"Automated vs. manual recap"** section.
- The readiness verdict must list what was NOT verified, with the explicit caveat
  that Salesforce performs its own penetration testing regardless of submitted
  evidence.
- White-box agent audits are described as static/code review — never as DAST or a
  pen test.

## 3. Genericization (public-repo hygiene)

- No partner-specific endpoints, org IDs, credentials, file paths, internal
  hostnames, or company-identifying detail. Field-tested patterns appear
  anonymized ("a FastAPI backend with Postgres row-level security", "a thin 2GP
  registration package").
- No partner-gated identifiers: no Trialforce Template IDs, no W-numbers
  (Salesforce work items), no verbatim text from login-gated docs. Cite them the
  way the sibling MCP toolkit does: "the MCP Client Partner Technical Guide
  (login-gated; ask in the Partnerblazer Slack MCP channel or via your Partner
  Account Manager)."
- The Salesforce partner Slack is referenced as a *place to ask*, never quoted.

## 4. Baseline-as-data (currency model)

All requirement facts live in `baseline/requirements-baseline.yaml` — never
hard-coded in skill prose. Each entry carries:

```yaml
- id: dast-scope-includes-identity-endpoints   # stable kebab id
  requirement: ...                   # one sentence
  details: ...                       # thresholds, formats, exact expectations
  applies_to: [managed-package | external-endpoint | mcp-server | canvas | both | all]
  automation: fully | partially | manual_only
  automation_notes: ...
  severity_if_missing: blocker | major | minor | informational
  sources:
    - url: ...
      date: ...                      # publication/updated date or "unknown"
      kind: official | community | partner_gated | empirical
  verification: verified_primary | web_research_unverified | conflicting
  last_verified: YYYY-MM-DD | null
  conflicts: ...                     # only when verification: conflicting
```

Rules:
- Skills MUST read the baseline at run time and warn when `last_verified` on the
  entries they use is older than **90 days** (the review process changed three
  times in 18 months: Chimera retirement, Code Analyzer v5, AgentExchange).
- `conflicting` entries are surfaced to the user as "verify with your Partner
  Account Manager / partner Slack before relying on this" — never silently picked.
- `partner_gated` sources are cited by name only (see §3).
- `baseline/SOURCES.md` is the registry: every source URL once, with what it
  corroborates and when it was last checked.

## 5. Skill structure (mirrors sf-mcp-partner-toolkit)

- Frontmatter: `name`, `description` (when to use it, in one breath),
  `allowed-tools` (narrowest workable set).
- Body sections in order: title · one-paragraph promise · **When to use** (with
  NOT-for bullets) · **Prerequisites** · numbered **Steps** · **Automated vs.
  manual recap** · **What feeds the next skill**.
- Steps encode *failure modes*, not happy paths — every "why" that cost someone a
  review cycle gets a sentence.
- Skills are self-contained: never assume another skill ran first; detect state
  and degrade. Cross-references use the installed form
  `/sf-security-review-toolkit:<skill>`.
- Shared assets are referenced as `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/baseline/...`,
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/methodology/...`, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/...`,
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/harness/...`.
- Multi-agent work: prefer the Workflow tool when available; every workflow has a
  documented sequential fallback using plain subagent (Task/Agent) calls.
- Declare token-cost expectations up front for anything that fans out agents
  (`quick` / `standard` / `exhaustive` tiers with approximate agent counts).

## 6. Target-repo state model

Skills write into the PARTNER's repo, never into the plugin:

- `<target>/docs/security-review/` — generated artifacts (committed, reviewable).
- `<target>/.security-review/` — machine state: `scope-manifest.json`,
  `audit-ledger.json`, `evidence/` (scan outputs, SSL Labs JSON, screenshots),
  `run-log.md`, `runs/run-<k>/audit-ledger.json` (per-run ledger snapshots for the
  cross-run stability read, audit-codebase step 9), and
  `recurrence-confidence.json` (the deterministic recurrence-confidence artifact).
  Recommend the partner commits this too (the ledger is what makes re-audits
  incremental), excluding any credential material.
- Nothing in state files may contain secrets; skills must refuse to write captured
  credentials and say where to put them instead (env vars, vaults).

## 7. Audit engine rules

- The find → **adversarial-verify** → synthesize loop is mandatory. Findings that
  skip verification are never shown as findings.
- Precision over volume: a finding requires exact file:line, a concrete
  `exploit_scenario` (attacker, request, impact), and survives a skeptical
  verifier who read the gating code. Correct controls are not findings.
- Severity taxonomy: `critical` (auto-fail / cross-tenant / key compromise),
  `high` (must fix before submission), `medium` (likely flagged; should fix),
  `low` (hardening), `info`. Verifiers emit `adjusted_severity`.
- The known-findings ledger (`audit-ledger.json`) carries every confirmed,
  refuted, fixed, and accepted-risk finding across runs; finder prompts embed
  the ledger as "do NOT re-report" context. This is what makes pass N+1 cheap
  and quiet.
- Dimensions are concept-stable, target-variable: each dimension file defines the
  threat concept, what "good" looks like, and **detection heuristics** for
  locating the relevant code per stack (the stack-adapter step resolves real
  paths before finders run).
- **Determinizable honesty claims are engine-backed, not narrated (0.5.0).** Any
  self-describing count, applicability set, readiness band/gate, finding de-dup,
  or staleness check MUST be computed by a pure `harness/*.mjs` engine — no LLM,
  no network, no dependencies, byte-identical on re-run — and guarded by a
  self-asserting `acceptance/test-*.mjs` standing test that fails the build if the
  property breaks. A rule that exists only as skill prose is only as strong as the
  model that remembers to invoke it (a cold-start run proved this twice: the
  AuthN/AuthZ-withhold gate, when it lived in journey narration, was improvised
  past on a resume path). The enforced form lives in `harness/artifact-gate.mjs`,
  `applicable-requirements.mjs`, `baseline-counts.mjs`, `finding-clusters.mjs`,
  `ledger-staleness.mjs`, `injection-check.mjs`, `package-readiness.mjs`,
  `compute-sci.mjs`, `recurrence-confidence.mjs` (cross-run recurrence
  classification over N ledgers — the variance is engine-classified, never
  narrated), and the per-run engines that replaced LLM-authored
  scripts — `build-audit-engine.mjs` (extract + inject the audit run-args),
  `build-artifact-engine.mjs` (the 0.8.21 P2-PARITY twin for the ARTIFACT phase:
  inject the artifact-drafting DATA into `artifact-workflow-template.mjs`, the same
  shipped-template-plus-injected-DATA pattern, so neither phase hand-authors a
  Workflow with inline prompt strings — the JS-escaping/parse-error class is gone
  from BOTH phases now),
  `merge-ledger.mjs` (mechanical ledger merge), and `build-evidence-index.mjs`
  (the evidence index + the reviewer-reproducible credit rule). The credit rule
  is the load-bearing one: SATISFIED requires reviewer-reproducible evidence;
  an audit-only clear is `statically-cleared` and never moves the headline (the
  toolkit must not grade its own exam). Prose-only fixes are permitted
  but must be labelled NOT-test-backed in the CHANGELOG (same residual class), and
  a high-stakes prose layer is a candidate for promotion to an engine + a
  PreToolUse hook (runtime-independent enforcement).
- **Operator-facing GATES are pinned by an engine, rendered VERBATIM by the driver
  (0.8.22).** The `AskUserQuestion` gate option sets were driver-improvised prose, and a
  cold campaign caught the drift (the same depth gate offered a different option set
  run-to-run). The fix applies the repo's contract — the ENGINE owns structure, the driver
  supplies data — to the gate class. `harness/gate-spec.mjs` is a FROZEN catalog keyed by
  gate id + a PURE `gateOptions(gateId, facts)` selector that returns
  `{gate, consent, header, question, options:[{label, description, decision}]}`. It mirrors
  `build-audit-engine`'s `ALWAYS_ON` (the decline/skip option is FORCE-INJECTED on every
  consent gate, so a caller cannot drop it), `build-artifact-engine`'s `FOCUS_MIN` THROW
  (FAIL CLOSED on an unknown gate id or any option missing `label`/`description`/`decision`,
  or a decision that is not a valid `record-consent` token — exactly `affirm`/`deny`), and
  `applicable-requirements`'s pure set-operation style (no LLM/network; the CLI's `--target`
  ledger read is the only FS touch). **The render-verbatim-gate contract:** the driver lists
  `gate-spec.mjs` in `allowed-tools`, calls it, renders each option's `label`/`description`
  VERBATIM (never paraphrases, reorders, or invents the option set), and pipes ONLY the
  chosen option's `decision` token to `record-consent.mjs --decision`. The engine owns the
  option set upstream; `record-consent` pins the decision downstream; the driver improvises
  neither. No silent behavior change — gate-spec only fixes WHICH options appear and their
  wording; the consent semantics (`record-consent` token, `build-audit-engine` fail-closed
  verify) are unchanged. **Slice 5 (0.8.27)** extends the catalog to the scope-submission gates
  (`mcp-probe`, `scope-confirm`, the `partner-program` six-gate family, `clarify-detection`,
  `listing-type`, `tenancy`) and adds a `kind` taxonomy (`consent | election | answer`,
  load-validated as `consent ⟺ kind:'consent'`) encoding TWO semantic classes: a CONSENT-to-act
  gate force-injects the decline and pipes its `decision` to `record-consent`; an ANSWER gate's
  selected option is RECORDED into the scope manifest (no force-injected decline, not piped).
  Guarded by `test-gate-spec.mjs` + `test-tier-no-reask.mjs` + `test-scope-gates.mjs`.
- **Operator-facing OUTPUT is pinned by render harnesses + `{{SLOT}}` templates,
  rendered VERBATIM by the driver (0.8.23–0.8.24).** The gate-spec rule's twin for the OUTPUT
  class — the readiness verdict / status / target-map renders were driver-improvised
  (a table one run, prose the next; reordered sections; a re-worded standing caveat).
  Two mechanisms, both ENGINE-owns-skeleton / driver-supplies-data:
  (1) **Render harnesses** extend a deterministic-JSON emitter with a fixed-block mode
  the way `compute-sci.mjs` does — `harness/render-stability.mjs` emits the verbatim
  Finding-Stability block from `recurrence-confidence.json` (0.8.23). Slice 3 (0.8.24,
  WI-04/WI-05) adds the entry-experience siblings: `render-target-map.mjs` (the approval
  table), `render-preflight.mjs` (the 3-tier report with the FIXED 4-state deployed-org
  enum), `render-scan-status.mjs` (the 8-row Family table), `render-router-status.mjs`
  (the 3-line "where are we?"), `render-recap.mjs` (the end-of-run recap, emitted by
  `merge-ledger.mjs`), and `finding-clusters.mjs --headline` (the triage headline — the
  FAILURE VERDICT, byte-identical at the audit exec summary AND the journey blocker gate).
  (2) **`templates/operator/*.md.tmpl`** `{{SLOT}}` skeletons with fixed `##` section
  order, each engine block wrapped in `<!-- RENDER:… -->` sentinels — filled by
  `harness/render-readiness-verdict.mjs`, which force-injects the SINGLE canonical
  `STANDING_CAVEAT` constant (so source and output can't diverge) and FAILS CLOSED on
  any unfilled `{{SLOT}}` (the "not submission-ready" lint, promoted from skill prose to
  an engine — mirrors `build-artifact-engine`'s missing-template throw).
  **The render-verbatim-output contract:** each pinned surface's skill (a) lists the
  render harness / template in `allowed-tools`, (b) carries "print the harness stdout /
  fill the `.tmpl` VERBATIM — never paraphrase, reorder, drop a column, or flip
  table↔prose", and (c) pastes deterministic blocks (the SCI block, the stability block)
  byte-for-byte. Policed by `lintRenderVerbatim` (`render-readiness-verdict.mjs`), which
  flags a skill that hand-builds a Markdown table for a surface that has a registered
  renderer/template. Guarded by `test-render-stability.mjs` + `test-readiness-verdict.mjs`
  + the Slice-3 tests (`test-finding-clusters-headline`, `test-render-target-map`,
  `test-render-preflight`, `test-render-scan-status`, `test-render-router-status`,
  `test-render-recap`) + the Slice-4 scope-submission REPORT renders (0.8.25, WI-06 reports
  half: `render-detected-elements.mjs` INV-15, `applicable-requirements.mjs --render` INV-16,
  `render-mcp-scope.mjs` INV-43+44 — the MCP renders never present an un-probed fact as probed —
  and `render-sf-autoresolve.mjs` INV-45 — which SURFACES every security flag + operator-answer
  conflict and NEVER renders a secret), guarded by `test-render-detected-elements`,
  `test-render-mcp-scope`, `test-render-sf-autoresolve`, and the extended
  `test-applicable-requirements`; each asserting determinism + a golden snapshot + fail-safe + the
  skill-wiring (grants + references + "print verbatim"). The Slice-5 final scope-summary
  (0.8.27, WI-06/INV-06: `render-scope-summary.mjs` — the fixed Step-9 readout whose
  operatorConfirmed gate states render HONESTLY (✓/✗/not-recorded, never a fabricated ✓) and whose
  missing-manifest branch renders "scope not finalized", never a fabricated "ready") is guarded by
  `test-render-scope-summary.mjs`.
- **Irreversible sf/host ops are consent-gated, fail-closed (0.8.11).** The
  deployed-package deep-audit skills run live, irreversible Salesforce / host ops
  (`sf package version promote` — a PERMANENT release — plus package install/uninstall,
  scratch-org create/delete, `sf data delete`, destructive deploy, `sf org login`,
  `npm install -g`) as prose-only Bash. Three consent gates back them —
  `sf-package-promote` (its own, for the permanent release), `sf-deep-audit-ops`, and
  `sf-cli-setup` — recorded via `harness/record-consent.mjs` under
  `.security-review/consent/`. The shipped PreToolUse hook `hooks/sf-ops-gate-hook.mjs`
  (matcher `Bash`) classifies the command on its ACTION VERB and **DENIES** a gated op,
  inside a managed audit repo, unless an affirmative consent is recorded — so a skipped
  ask cannot run the op. Scoped to a `.security-review/` tree (never blocks arbitrary
  Bash) and verb-based (read-only verbs always pass). Honest residual: a deliberately
  obfuscated op can still evade the classifier — the same limit the consent belt
  documents (see `docs/sf-ops-safety-gate.md`).
- **The ONE network-touching engine is `install-scanners.mjs`, and it is split to
  keep the no-network rule intact (0.6.0).** Every other `harness/*.mjs` is pure,
  no-network, byte-identical. `install-scanners.mjs` installs missing scan tools, so
  its EXECUTOR must reach the network — the documented exception. It is split so the
  honesty model still holds: `planInstalls()` is the PURE, byte-identical, test-backed
  half (the plan — per-tool dir, literal commands, pinned URL+sha256, PATH-prepend);
  `installScanners()` is the impure executor and **fails closed without explicit
  `consent` at the engine boundary** (a network install is the 0.5.4 P0 class —
  silence-is-yes never covers it, and the gate is re-asserted in code so a forgetful
  caller still cannot install). Raw binary downloads are **sha256-verified against an
  author-pinned checksum before the file is ever made executable or extracted**; no pin
  ⇒ skipped → PENDING-OWNER-RUN, never run unverified. Bumping a pinned tool means
  re-pinning the version AND every per-platform sha256 from the release's published
  checksums. `cleanup-scanners.mjs` (the asymmetric remover) is manifest-driven and
  likewise reads/removes only what the executor recorded. **(0.8.41)** the consented
  install set also includes the **Code Analyzer stack** (`code-analyzer-stack` method:
  the pinned `@salesforce/cli` + the `code-analyzer` plugin from npm + a JDK 11+ — a
  present `java`≥11 reused, else the sha256-pinned Temurin), so CRUD/FLS is
  deterministic-by-default on a cold box. Its load-bearing rule is the **hermeticity
  contract**: the full contained env (`HOME`/`SF_*`/`TMPDIR`/`npm_config_cache`/
  `JAVA_HOME`, every path under the tmp root) is set BEFORE the npm install (the CLI's
  postinstall hooks fire during it) and passed to every exec, so the same structural
  `rm -rf <tmpRoot>` removes it with zero residue — `test-install-scanners` asserts every
  CA-stack env path + `pathPrepend` entry stays under the tmp root.

- **Findings carry PROVENANCE; a deterministic engine's result is relayed, never
  re-judged (0.8.28, Phase 1 · Slice 1 of `docs/roadmap-deterministic-findings.md`).** A
  5-run cold campaign proved the LLM-generated blocker band is unstable run-to-run while
  Code Analyzer (PMD/SFGE) finds the same CRUD/FLS bugs deterministically every run — its
  output just never reached the ledger. `harness/ingest-scanner-findings.mjs` is that path:
  a scanner/metadata finding becomes a `provenance:'deterministic'` ledger finding carrying
  the `engine` + `ruleId` that fired, with `adjusted_severity` taken from the requirement
  CLASS (read live from `baseline/requirements-baseline.yaml` via the new canonical
  `REQ_SEVERITY_TO_FINDING` map — `blocker→critical / major→high / minor→low /
  informational→info`), never the scanner's own 1–5 number and never an LLM. It is a
  PLUGGABLE adapter registry (`ingest(raw, adapter)` core + `{name, kind, collect, parse,
  classify}` adapters) with two KINDS — `file-parser` (Code Analyzer; future Semgrep/OSV/
  gitleaks/Checkov are new adapter objects, not surgery) and `source-scanner` (the
  `metadata-viewall` ViewAll/ModifyAll over-grant check, the one class Code Analyzer
  doesn't cover). The core is pure/byte-deterministic (`collect()` is the only I/O seam),
  an unmapped rule is still ingested (never dropped) with a documented Code-Analyzer-severity
  fallback, and re-ingest is idempotent (a deterministic id is stable from
  `engine+ruleId+file:line`). **Slice 2 (0.8.29) adds the correctness core:** (1) a
  Security/AppExchange **tag filter** — only a Code Analyzer rule tagged `Security` or
  `AppExchange` becomes a finding (raw CA output is dominated by ApexDoc/naming/codestyle/
  Performance noise); a FILTER on non-security noise, never a drop of a security finding
  (an unmapped *security* rule still ingests via the CA-severity fallback). (2) A mapped
  finding now carries its owned-`class` label, and `harness/reconcile-provenance.mjs`
  ENFORCES supersession — a `deterministic` finding in the SAME owned class at the SAME
  locus (reusing `finding-clusters.mjs` `sameLocation`) demotes a co-located `llm-inferred`
  finding to `status:'superseded'` (`superseded_by` → the deterministic id), pure +
  idempotent, so the LLM can never re-report or re-judge what an engine determined. (3) The
  engine-absent→**KEEP** methodology fix (`apex-exposed-surface.md` §5/§6): defer a CRUD/FLS
  gap to SFGE ONLY when a `code-analyzer-*.json` evidence file proves it ran — engine-absent
  → keep the finding `llm-inferred` and mark the class PENDING-OWNER-RUN, never refute by a
  phantom hand-off (the fixrun4 dropped-blocker). **Slice 3 (0.8.30) WIRES both engines into
  the flow — PHASE 1 COMPLETE:** audit-codebase runs the deterministic pass FIRST (Step 4,
  before the ledger digest is compiled and before the LLM fan-out — `metadata-viewall` always + `code-analyzer` when a
  `code-analyzer-*.json` evidence file exists; `sf` absent → PENDING-OWNER-RUN, never LLM-fill,
  never drop) and `reconcile-provenance.mjs` LAST (end of Step 6, after `merge-ledger.mjs`),
  with Step 7 re-rendering the recap off the reconciled band; the journey + run-scans document
  the same ordering; and `docs/deterministic-findings-acceptance.md` is the live-Solano runbook
  (the campaign replacement — run the engine twice → identical, end-to-end). The three wobbled
  classes are now deterministic end-to-end. Guarded by `test-ingest-scanner-findings.mjs`
  (determinism + severity-from-class + the tag filter + schema conformance over REAL captured
  Code Analyzer fixtures), `test-reconcile-provenance.mjs` (supersession is precise,
  conservative, idempotent), `test-deterministic-integration.mjs` (the real CLI sequence
  end-to-end + the journey/audit-codebase grant+invoke+order wiring), and a
  `test-calibration-fp-patterns.mjs` presence guard on the engine-absent → KEEP clause. **Phase 2
  (0.8.31) ships the first §10 per-scanner adapter — `checkov`** (file-parser, `engine:'checkov'`,
  IaC misconfig): Checkov `failed_checks` (single-object OR multi-framework array shape) become
  `provenance:'deterministic'` `iac-misconfig` findings (baseline `scan-iac-misconfig` = major →
  high), via a CONSTANT `classify()` and NO tag filter (security-by-construction, like
  `metadata-viewall`). Severity is the CLASS, never the tool — Checkov OSS emits `severity:null`,
  so a literal tool→band map has no input (a curated per-check / enterprise-severity refinement is
  a Phase-2b follow-up). One new adapter object in the existing registry, never a rewrite; guarded
  by the `CK*` checks in `test-ingest-scanner-findings.mjs`. **Phase 2 (0.8.32) ships the second §10
  adapter — `semgrep`** (file-parser, `engine:'semgrep'`, multi-language SAST), the FIRST genuine
  **`tool→band`** adapter: unlike code-analyzer/checkov, Semgrep carries a real per-result severity
  (`ERROR`/`WARNING`/`INFO`), so the tool's own band DRIVES the finding severity
  (`SEMGREP_SEVERITY_TO_FINDING` — `ERROR→high` [deliberately NOT critical/blocker: reachability is
  the LLM/human residual], `WARNING→medium`, `INFO→low`, unknown→`info`). This required a small
  ADDITIVE generalization of `buildFinding` — a third severity path on the UNMAPPED side gated on an
  optional `bandFromTool`/`dimensionHint`/`toolSevLabel`; the MAPPED class-severity branch is
  UNCHANGED (a mapped `classKey` always wins). A Semgrep finding owns NO toolkit class
  (`classify()`→`null`) so it supersedes nothing — cross-engine dedup against a co-located LLM
  finding is §10 extension #3 (Phase-2b). `dimension:'external-sast'`; NO tag filter
  (security-by-construction, the security rulesets). Guarded by the `SG*` checks (two real
  fixtures — a WARNING anchor + an ERROR anchor). **Phase 2 (0.8.33) ships the third §10 adapter —
  `bandit`** (file-parser, `engine:'bandit'`, Python SAST), the SECOND `tool→band` adapter and the
  PROOF the Semgrep generalization GENERALIZES: Bandit carries a real per-result `issue_severity`
  (`HIGH`/`MEDIUM`/`LOW`, via `BANDIT_SEVERITY_TO_FINDING` — `HIGH→high` [same call as Semgrep
  `ERROR→high`, not critical/blocker], `MEDIUM→medium`, `LOW→low`, unknown/missing→`info`), owns no
  class (`classify()`→`null`), and groups under `external-sast` — exactly Semgrep's shape — so it
  REUSES `buildFinding`'s `bandFromTool` path with **ZERO harness-core change** (one new adapter +
  one severity map; no `buildFinding`/`CLASS_DEFS` edit). `issue_confidence` is recorded but NOT
  band-weighting here (a Phase-2b note). Guarded by the `BN*` checks (one real all-`MEDIUM` fixture +
  inline `HIGH`/`LOW`/unknown synthetics). **Phase 2 (0.8.34) ships the fourth §10 adapter —
  `njsscan`** (file-parser, `engine:'njsscan'`, Node SAST), the THIRD `tool→band` adapter and the
  FIRST with a DIFFERENT input shape: njsscan's JSON is a NESTED OBJECT (`{nodejs:{…},templates:{…}}`,
  each section keyed by rule_id), NOT a flat `results[]` — so it has its own `parse` that reads BOTH
  sections (a rule can list multiple files → one finding per file occurrence) and derives the CWE
  reference URL from a `CWE-###` prefix. Everything downstream is the established `tool→band` pattern:
  severity from `metadata.severity` (`NJSSCAN_SEVERITY_TO_FINDING` — `ERROR→high` [same call as
  Semgrep/Bandit], `WARNING→medium`, `INFO→low`, unknown/missing→`info`), `classify()`→`null` (owns no
  class), `dimension:'external-sast'`, NO tag filter (security-by-construction) — so it REUSES
  `buildFinding`'s `bandFromTool` path with **ZERO harness-core change** (one new adapter + one
  severity map; no `buildFinding`/`CLASS_DEFS` edit). njsscan's `node_secret` (CWE-798) OVERLAPS the
  secrets class the future gitleaks/detect-secrets adapters will own; de-duplicating it is cross-engine
  dedup = §10 ext #3 (Phase-2b), not this slice (the SAFE under-merge). Guarded by the `NJ*` checks
  (one real fixture — an ERROR anchor + a WARNING anchor — plus templates-section / multi-file /
  no-CWE / band synthetics). **Phase 2 (0.8.35) ships the fifth §10 adapter — `gitleaks`**
  (file-parser, `engine:'gitleaks'`, hardcoded secrets), a DESIGN PIVOT BACK to **`class`-severity**
  (like checkov, NOT `tool→band`): a secret has no tool-severity tier, so severity comes from the
  `fail-hardcoded-secrets` CLASS (major → high) via a CONSTANT `classify()`→`'hardcoded-secrets'` and
  NO tag filter (security-by-construction), with **ZERO `buildFinding`/`CLASS_DEFS`-machinery change**
  beyond one new `CLASS_DEFS` entry + one adapter + one `recommendationFor` arm. TWO things make
  gitleaks distinct: (1) it owns a class AND a REAL methodology dimension (`secrets-credentials`), so —
  unlike the deterministic-only `external-sast` label — it **SUPERSEDES a co-located LLM
  `secrets-credentials` finding** (the first adapter to enforce, for its class, that the LLM does not
  re-report what the scanner determined; the bounded over-supersede risk is the same already-accepted
  dimension-fallback risk as `crud-fls`/`sharing`, hardening tracked under §10 ext #3); (2) gitleaks
  output CONTAINS the live secret (`Match`/`Secret`) + commit PII (`Author`/`Email`/`Message`), so the
  adapter is built to emit a finding from ONLY the non-sensitive fields
  (`RuleID`/`File`/`StartLine`/`Description`) and NEVER pass any secret/PII downstream — the
  **secret-never-leaks invariant** (`buildFinding`'s `redact()` is only a backstop, not the primary
  control). Cross-engine dedup of the same secret found by gitleaks AND njsscan's `node_secret` is still
  §10 ext #3 (Phase-2b — the SAFE under-merge). Guarded by the `GL*` checks (one real 3×
  `generic-api-key` fixture, the load-bearing secret-never-leaks test, and the LLM-supersession test).
  **Phase 2 (0.8.36) ships the sixth §10 adapter — `detect-secrets`** (file-parser,
  `engine:'detect-secrets'`, hardcoded secrets), the secrets SIBLING of gitleaks: the same vuln class, so
  it **REUSES the `hardcoded-secrets` class** gitleaks added — **NO new `CLASS_DEFS` entry, NO
  `buildFinding`/`recommendationFor` change** (a `class`-severity adapter, severity from
  `fail-hardcoded-secrets` → high via a CONSTANT `classify()`→`'hardcoded-secrets'`, NO tag filter,
  security-by-construction). The ONLY shared-file touch is the `ADAPTERS` registry line. Like gitleaks it
  owns a class AND the real `secrets-credentials` dimension, so it SUPERSEDES a co-located LLM secrets
  finding. TWO things are new vs gitleaks: (1) detect-secrets' OWN **nested-by-file** JSON
  (`{results:{<file>:[occurrence,…]}}`, `results` keyed by FILE, NOT gitleaks' flat array), so its own
  `parse`; (2) with TWO secrets engines now live, the same secret at one locus produces TWO deterministic
  ledger rows — `reconcile-provenance` does NOT collapse them (it only supersedes an `llm-inferred` finding;
  a deterministic finding never supersedes another deterministic finding), so the cross-engine duplicate is
  VISIBLE (the SAFE under-merge) — collapsing it is cross-engine dedup = §10 ext #3 (Phase-2b), now
  concrete. The **hash/secret-never-leaks invariant** applies again: an occurrence carries a `hashed_secret`
  (a SHA) and, under `--show-secrets`, could carry plaintext; the adapter emits from ONLY
  `type`/file/`line_number` and NEVER the hash or plaintext (`redact()` is only a backstop). Guarded by the
  `DS*` checks (one real 24-occurrence / 6-file / 3-type fixture, the load-bearing hash+plaintext leak test,
  the LLM-supersession test, and the two-deterministic-coexist test). **Phase 2 (0.8.37) ships the seventh §10
  adapter — `osv`** (file-parser, `engine:'osv'`, dependency-CVE / SCA), and with it **Extension A: the
  CVSS→enum advisory-severity fork** (§10 extension #1). Unlike the SAST family (tool tier ERROR/WARNING/INFO →
  band) and the class-severity adapters (checkov/gitleaks/detect-secrets → class), a dep CVE carries a REAL
  CVSS, while the only CLASS severity (`scan-external-sca` = major) is a *missing-scan* GATE severity — so the
  per-FINDING band is PER-ADVISORY (`severityKind:'advisory'`): numeric group `max_severity` →
  `CVSS_SCORE_TO_FINDING` (the CVSS 3.x scale — ≥9.0 critical · ≥7.0 high · ≥4.0 medium · >0 low · 0 info), else
  the vuln's `database_specific.severity` LABEL → `OSV_LABEL_TO_FINDING`, else `medium` (an unscored CVE is real
  — the conservative middle, NOT info, NOT the gate's high). It REUSES `buildFinding`'s `bandFromTool` path
  (`classify()`→`null`, owns no class, supersedes nothing; `dimension:'dependency-cve'`, deterministic-only; NO
  tag filter) — the band SOURCE (CVSS, not a tool tier) is the only difference — so the **ONLY shared-code change
  is the additive `gateLabel` parameter** on `buildFinding`'s tool→band branch (`scan-external-sca` for SCA;
  the default `scan-external-sast` preserves the SAST adapters' reasoning byte-for-byte). dep-CVEs have no
  file:line (locus = the lockfile/package). Guarded by the `OSV*` checks (one real 11-vuln fixture + inline
  CVSS→enum threshold synthetics + the severity-priority cases + the load-bearing gate-label-default-preserved
  regression). **Phase 2 (0.8.38) ships the eighth §10 adapter — `npm-audit`** (file-parser,
  `engine:'npm-audit'`, Node dependency-CVE), the **EASY Extension-A REUSE**: `npm audit --json`
  (`auditReportVersion:2`) gives a DIRECT severity LABEL per vulnerable package
  (`critical/high/moderate/low/info`), so the band comes straight from `NPM_SEVERITY_TO_FINDING` (npm's own
  lowercase `moderate`→medium spelling, its OWN named map — NOT OSV's UPPERCASE one), a label-only band with no
  CVSS parsing. It REUSES OSV's path EXACTLY — the `bandFromTool` branch, the `gateLabel` parameter (already
  added at 0.8.37), the `dependency-cve` dimension, `classify()`→`null` (owns no class, supersedes nothing), NO
  tag filter — so there is **NO `buildFinding`/`CLASS_DEFS` change**; the ONLY shared-file touch is the
  `ADAPTERS` registry line. Gated by `scan-dependency-vulnerabilities` (`applies_to: [all]`, major — DISTINCT
  from OSV's `scan-external-sca`; both major). One finding per vulnerable package (npm keys by package, severity
  is the package MAX); `via` supplies the advisory title/url (a STRING via-entry is a transitive chain, an
  OBJECT via-entry is the direct advisory; the band uses the PACKAGE severity, not the first advisory's).
  Unknown/blank → medium (judgment call, as OSV). Guarded by the `NPM*` checks (one real 4-package fixture +
  inline label→band synthetics + the via-shape matrix + the package-severity-wins + no-vector-leak +
  gate-label checks). **Phase 2 (0.8.39) ships the ninth §10 adapter — `trivy`** (file-parser,
  `engine:'trivy'`, IaC misconfig), done **CONFIG mode only** (the only mode with a captured fixture). A Trivy
  `Class:'config'` finding is the SAME vuln class as Checkov, so it **REUSES the `iac-misconfig` class** (NO new
  `CLASS_DEFS` entry, NO `buildFinding` change — like detect-secrets reused `hardcoded-secrets`): a CLASS-severity
  adapter at class `high` (`scan-iac-misconfig`=major), NOT a tool→band path; the ONLY shared-file touch is the
  `ADAPTERS` registry line. The parse is **CLASS-DISPATCH** (forward-compatible): `Class:'config'` handled now, the
  vuln (os-pkgs/lang-pkgs) and `secret` classes SKIPPED (Phase-2b — no fixtures yet). Only `Status:'FAIL'`
  misconfigs are findings; `ruleId` prefers `AVDID` else `ID`; `file` is the `Target` (+`:StartLine` when
  `CauseMetadata.StartLine` is present). **Consistency call:** Trivy carries a per-misconfig `Severity`, but for the
  same class to be consistent across engines it lands at class-severity EXACTLY like Checkov (its `Severity`
  recorded in the message *for reference*, never moving the band) — the per-tool-severity refinement for
  `iac-misconfig` (Checkov + Trivy both) stays the same Phase-2b item flagged at Checkov. Guarded by the `TRV*`
  checks (one real DS-0026 fixture + the class-severity-consistency mutation `LOW→CRITICAL` stays `high` + a
  class-dispatch synthetic + a `Status:'PASS'`-skip + a reuses-class assertion). The remaining §10 adapters
  (build order 2b) continue: **trivy SCA/secret modes** still 2b, then ext #3 (cross-engine dedup: OSV↔npm on the
  same CVE + Checkov↔Trivy on the same IaC misconfig — now concrete with two IaC engines) + `gosec` (needs a Go
  fixture) + `retire` + the tls/dast specials.

non-security noise filtered, an unmapped SECURITY rule still kept) + a mapped finding carries its owned-`class` label. 0.8.31 (Phase 2·2a #1): the `checkov` adapter (file-parser, engine:'checkov', IaC misconfig) — parses Checkov failed_checks (single-object OR multi-framework array) into iac-misconfig findings, CONSTANT classify() (not in RULE_CLASS), NO tag filter (security-by-construction like metadata-viewall), severity from the iac-misconfig CLASS (scan-iac-misconfig=major→high;

node_secret/CWE-798 overlaps the future secrets class → cross-engine dedup is §10 ext #3 (Phase-2b). 0.8.35 (Phase 2·2a #5): the `gitleaks` adapter (file-parser, engine:'gitleaks', hardcoded secrets) — a DESIGN PIVOT BACK to class-severity (like checkov): a secret carries no tool tier, so severity from the fail-hardcoded-secrets CLASS (major→high) via a CONSTANT classify()→'hardcoded-secrets'; owns a class AND the real secrets-credentials dimension, so it SUPERSEDES a co-located LLM secrets finding; the secret-never-leaks invariant (emit only RuleID/File/StartLine/Description, NEVER Match/Secret/Message/Author/Email); input is a JSON array. 0.8.36 (Phase 2·2a #6): the `detect-secrets` adapter (file-parser, engine:'detect-secrets', hardcoded secrets) — the secrets SIBLING of gitleaks: REUSES the hardcoded-secrets class (NO new CLASS_DEFS/buildFinding change), nested-by-file JSON ({results:{<file>:[…]}}), the hash/secret-never-leaks invariant (emit only type/file/line_number); two secrets engines → the same secret yields two deterministic rows (the SAFE under-merge, cross-engine dedup = ext #3). 0.8.37 (Phase 2·2a #7): the `osv` adapter (file-parser, engine:'osv', dependency-CVE/SCA) — Extension A: the CVSS→enum advisory-severity fork: per-FINDING band from the advisory's CVSS via CVSS_SCORE_TO_FINDING (else database_specific.severity LABEL → OSV_LABEL_TO_FINDING, else medium), the class governs only the gate; the ONLY shared-code change is the additive gateLabel param (scan-external-sca; default scan-external-sast preserves the SAST adapters byte-for-byte); classify()→null, dimension 'dependency-cve', no file:line (locus=lockfile/package). 0.8.38 (Phase 2·2a #8): the `npm-audit` adapter (file-parser, engine:'npm-audit', Node dependency-CVE) — the EASY Extension-A REUSE: a DIRECT severity LABEL per package via NPM_SEVERITY_TO_FINDING (npm's lowercase moderate→medium spelling;

gated by scan-dependency-vulnerabilities (applies_to all, major — distinct from OSV's scan-external-sca); one finding per package, via supplies the advisory title/url (string via = transitive chain, object via = direct advisory), band uses the PACKAGE severity. 0.8.39 (Phase 2·2a #9): the `trivy` adapter (file-parser, engine:'trivy', IaC misconfig) — CONFIG mode ONLY this slice (the only mode with a captured fixture). A Trivy Class:'config' finding is the SAME vuln class as Checkov, so it REUSES the iac-misconfig class (NO new CLASS_DEFS/buildFinding change — like detect-secrets reused hardcoded-secrets), a CLASS-severity adapter at class high (scan-iac-misconfig=major), NOT a tool→band path; the ONLY shared-file touch is the ADAPTERS line. The parse is CLASS-DISPATCH (forward-compatible): Class:'config' now, the vuln (os-pkgs/lang-pkgs) and secret classes SKIPPED (Phase-2b — no fixtures). Only Status:'FAIL' misconfigs are findings; ruleId prefers AVDID else ID; file is the Target (+:StartLine when CauseMetadata.StartLine is present); classify()→'iac-misconfig' (constant), NO tag filter (security-by-construction). CONSISTENCY CALL: Trivy carries a per-misconfig Severity, but lands at class-severity EXACTLY like Checkov (its Severity recorded in the message for reference, never moving the band) — the per-tool-severity refinement for iac-misconfig (Checkov+Trivy both) is the same Phase-2b item flagged at Checkov; Checkov↔Trivy on the same IaC misconfig (DS-0026↔CKV_DOCKER_2) = §10 ext #3 (Phase-2b, the SAFE under-merge). 0.8.40 (Phase 2 journey-wiring): the `--all` mode + content-shape recognizer — each file-parser adapter carries a `detect(raw)→boolean` predicate, `recognizeScanner(raw)` returns the SINGLE matching adapter name by CONTENT SHAPE (never filename, which is heterogeneous/ambiguous) / null / {ambiguous} (the shapes are provably disjoint, 40/40 on real evidence; >1 match fails loud, never guesses), and `ingestAll({target})` ALWAYS runs metadata-viewall then recognizes + ingests every `evidence/*.json` into the deterministic band in ONE byte-deterministic pass (Code-Analyzer-absent → CRUD/FLS+sharing PENDING-OWNER-RUN). WIRED into the journey at audit-codebase Step 4b (replaces the two `--scanner` calls) + the run-scans scan tail (`--all` then reconcile). buildFinding/ingest/CLASS_DEFS/the per-`--scanner` dispatch are byte-UNCHANGED (additive-only). 0.8.56 (B5 #1): the `regexploit` adapter (file-parser, engine:'regexploit', ReDoS/CWE-1333 — run-scans Family 7 leg) — the FIRST format-C (non-JSON) adapter: regexploit emits TEXT only, so the evidence is its VERBATIM stdout (redos-<date>.txt), parse() reads the tool's own block format (`#N` = the source line; a multi-record block bands from the WORST starriness), tool→band via REDOS_DEGREE_TO_FINDING (exponential→high · polynomial→medium · unknown→medium — never blocker, reachability is the labelled residual), gateLabel resource-consumption-abuse (major, the RCA baseline id), ruleId = redos-<sha16(pattern)>; classify()→null BY DESIGN — resource-consumption-abuse is MULTI-SHAPE and sameOwnedClass falls back to a dimension match, so an owned class would supersede co-located rate-limit/denial-of-wallet LLM findings (locked by the RD-non-supersession standing test); detect() matches only the raw TEXT string ⇒ `--all` (JSON-only enumeration) never auto-recognizes it — the explicit `--scanner regexploit --input` form is the documented ingest route. 0.8.57 (B5 · E0.1): reachability-path ingest — semgrepAdapter.parse() now CAPTURES a taint-mode result's `extra.dataflow_trace` (the source→sink dataflow path the scanner computed and the adapter previously discarded) as `hit.reachabilityPath`, normalized to `{source:{file,line}, intermediate:[{file,line}…], sink:{file,line}}` from the REAL captured nesting (taint_source/taint_sink are tagged `['CliLoc',[location,content]]` pairs; intermediate_vars are `{content,location}` objects; content strings DROPPED — locations only), and buildFinding attaches `reachabilityPath` + `reachable:true` when present — a PURE ADDITIVE attribute (never in the id hash/severity/band/reasoning; a trace-less finding carries NEITHER field and is byte-identical, locked by SG-RP2); an absent/malformed trace attaches nothing and never throws (SG-RP1/RP3); newer Semgrep CLIs serialize the trace to text/SARIF only (their --json omits it) — such captures carry no attribute; the ledger schema gains the matching optional `reachable`/`reachabilityPath` finding properties (+ `trace_step` def). The path is the deterministic reachability substrate the later residual-shrinking slices consume. 0.8.58 (B5 · E0.1b): per-hit CWE→dimension routing for the external-SAST adapters — semgrep + bandit compute dimensionHint PER HIT via dimensionForCwes over INJECTION_XSS_CWES (an EXACT integer-CWE allowlist: 89 SQL/SOQL injection + 78 OS-command injection, the two fixture-proven ids; 79/94/643/917 pre-registered comment-only until a fixture lands), reading each tool's REAL captured shape (semgrep extra.metadata.cwe 'CWE-###[: title]' string-or-array, anchored so CWE-789 never reads as 78; bandit issue_cwe.id integer; malformed/absent → 'external-sast', never a throw) so an allowlisted injection finding files under the REAL injection-xss dimension while the co-resident CWE-939 SSRF / CWE-22 path-traversal / CWE-798 secrets / CWE-693 misconfig findings stay 'external-sast' (negative-routing lock); ROUTING ONLY — gate (scan-external-sast), band, id hash, reasoning unchanged, and classify() stays null on BOTH adapters (injection-xss is MULTI-SHAPE: an owned class would supersede a co-located LLM finding of a DIFFERENT injection shape via the dimension fallback — locked by INJ-non-supersession, the RD-non-supersession posture ported); njsscan/code-analyzer untouched (no captured injection finding to prove a reroute — deferred with the deserialization/session-token routings until fixtures land). 0.8.59 (B5 · E0.1b-EXPAND): the injection taxonomy EXPANDED across what OSS scanners actually emit + njsscan JOINED the CWE-routed adapters — INJECTION_XSS_CWES grows from {78,89} to {78,89,79,94,95,96,943}, each new id proven by a GENERATED per-sub-class fixture (semgrep 1.168.0 / bandit 1.9.4 / njsscan 0.4.2): 79 XSS (njsscan express_xss + semgrep raw-html-format/direct-response-write) · 94 code injection (bandit B701 jinja2_autoescape_false) · 95 eval (njsscan eval_nodejs + semgrep eval-injection) · 96 template/SSTI-static-code (semgrep render-template-string) · 943 NoSQL (njsscan node_nosqli_js_injection); njsscanAdapter.parse() now sets dimensionHint via dimensionForCwes(md.cwe) — njsscan's real 'CWE-###: …' string is the SAME shape cweIdsOf already normalizes, so ZERO helper change (cweIdsOf/dimensionForCwes byte-identical); RULE-PATH-PROVEN not class-proven (a green fixture proves the ONE rule that fired, a partner hitting the class via a rule with absent/different CWE metadata can still land external-sast); the co-resident CWE-352 CSRF (+ 939/22/798/693) stays external-sast (SSRF 918 + path-traversal 22 → data-export per the injection-xss.md boundary; XXE 611 → deserialization, a sibling slice), and 643 XPath/90 LDAP/91 XML-injection/917·1336 EL stay fixture-pending (no OSS rule emitted them on a minimal seed); ROUTING ONLY (gate/band/id/reasoning unchanged), classify() stays null on ALL THREE SAST adapters — a routed finding owns no class and supersedes nothing, now locked for a newly-added sub-class by INJ-non-supersession-new-subclass. 0.8.61 (B5 · E0.2b): the `sarif` adapter (file-parser; engine from `run.tool.driver.name`, lowercased first token — 'opengrep'/'semgrep'/'codeql', NEVER hardcoded) — the VERSION-PORTABLE reachability surface: SARIF 2.1.0 `codeFlows[]→threadFlows[]→locations[]` (the OASIS-standardized taint-path serialization opengrep/semgrep-Pro/CodeQL all emit) normalized by `_sarifReachabilityPath` (sibling of `_reachabilityPath`: executionOrder-when-complete else array order, [0]=source/[last]=sink/middle=intermediates, BOTH-ends-or-nothing, every spec-optional sub-object guarded — zero/partial/malformed flows attach nothing and never throw; `artifactLocation.uri` VERBATIM minus a defensive file:// strip, never joined against originalUriBaseIds which would re-embed the scan host's absolute path) to the SAME `{source,intermediate[],sink}` normal form as the semgrep-JSON trace (standing equivalence check over genuine captures of the identical seeded sample); tool→band from the result `level` via the rule's `defaultConfiguration` fallback (SARIF_LEVEL_TO_FINDING error→high · warning→medium · note→low · unknown→info, never dropped), the same per-hit CWE routing from the rule's `properties.tags` ('CWE-###' strings — the exact array shape cweIdsOf already normalizes), classify()→null (owns no class, supersedes nothing); `ingestAll` now enumerates `evidence/*.sarif` alongside `*.json` (the runs[] shape is disjoint from every other detect). PLUS the `opengrep` adapter (engine:'opengrep') — the D1 engine-label fix: opengrep `--json` is content-INDISTINGUISHABLE from semgrep's (identical key sets at every level, engine_kind 'OSS' on both — verified on the captured fixture pair, NO distinguishing field exists), so it carries NO detect (the format recognizer honestly routes the shape to 'semgrep'); parse DELEGATES to semgrepAdapter verbatim + re-labels engine:'opengrep' (the existing `_reachabilityPath` parses opengrep JSON — the trace is default-on there), provenance from the explicit `--scanner opengrep` form or ingestAll's documented `opengrep-<date>.json` evidence-name refinement (label-only, never routing; visibly noted), and a JSON+SARIF capture of the SAME hit converges on ONE finding id (same engine+ruleId+file:line — cross-surface dedup by construction). ADJUDICATED BY CAPTURE: on the identical sample+rule where opengrep emits a 4-step flow, semgrep CE 1.168.0 `--sarif --dataflow-traces` emitted NO codeFlows → the CE-SARIF reachability surface is PENDING (Pro-gated), pinned by the SG-SARIF-CE-PENDING standing check — nothing fabricated; and opengrep 1.25.0 SARIF requires `--dataflow-traces` for codeFlows (its JSON does not) — both documented Family-7 commands carry the flag. The semgrep-JSON path + buildFinding byte-unchanged. 0.8.66 (B5 · E0.3b-1): the `egress-plain-http` adapter (source-scanner, engine:'metadata') — the THIRD source-scanner, metadata-viewall's clone: walks the repo for the declarative egress-config metadata (*.remoteSite-meta.xml / *.cspTrustedSite-meta.xml / *.namedCredential-meta.xml) and flags every endpoint declared over plain http:// — RemoteSiteSetting <url>, CspTrustedSite <endpointUrl>, NamedCredential legacy <endpoint> + modern (API 56.0+) <parameterValue> where the sibling <parameterType> is Url — the codified Secure Communication violation. NEW owned class plain-http-egress (endpoint-https-only = major → high; dimension package-metadata, whose charter owns the trusted-host XML http:// flags); CONSTANT classify(), NO securityRelevant (security-by-construction), NO detect (source-scanner — no evidence file). PRECISION: the scheme match is ANCHORED (https:// never matches — no /https?/ shortcut) and element-scoped (an http:// in a <description>, or the xmlns URI itself, never flags). The owned class is single-shape AT ITS LOCUS (the specific http:// URL line): supersession reaches only a co-located LLM finding on that same endpoint line (correct — the deterministic row is authoritative there), never a different-shape package-metadata finding elsewhere in the file (EG-non-supersession, mutation-proven). HONEST FLOOR: the finding is a statically-declared insecure-transport endpoint in committed config, NOT a confirmed leak (actual egress + TLS behavior are runtime), and NO secret finding is emitted from a credential file (secret values are org-encrypted, never in metadata). ingestAll (--all) now ALWAYS runs BOTH source-scanners. Wildcard-host / over-broad egress, Apex setEndpoint('http://…') literals, and the host↔NamedCredential join are named follow-on slices. 0.8.67 (B5 · E0.3c-1): the `view-modify-all-data` adapter (source-scanner #4, engine:'metadata') — scans *.permissionset-meta.xml AND *.profile-meta.xml for the org-wide ViewAllData/ModifyAllData SYSTEM permission granted via <userPermissions> with <enabled>true</enabled> — the org-wide sharing-bypass over-grant (NEW owned class view-modify-all-data → fail-sharing-model major → high, dimension admin-surface; the org-wide analogue of viewall-overgrant's per-object flags). EXACT-name ({ViewAllData, ModifyAllData} — ViewAllUsers never matches) + enabled-required (an explicit enabled=false row never flags) + element-scoped (a <description> mention never flags). Covers exactly the gap metadata-viewall leaves (system <userPermissions>, and profiles, which that scan never reads) — the two source-scanners are DISJOINT, no double-report (PV-no-overlap). HONEST FLOOR: a statically-declared sharing-bypass grant (FLS still applies), never a confirmed leak, and retrieved profile metadata may be PARTIAL — absence of a grant is not least-privilege proof. ingestAll (--all) runs all THREE source-scanners. ManageUsers/AuthorApex, per-object profile grants, the permission-set-group + muting composition, and the release-widening diff are named follow-on slices

## 9. Writing voice

Dense, specific, failure-encoded — match the sibling MCP toolkit. Tables for
matrices, prose for reasoning. No marketing language, no "simply", no unexplained
acronyms on first use. American spelling.

## 10. Docs lifecycle (prevent roadmap rot)

`docs/` stays current and tracked, never a graveyard of half-built plans. The rules:

- **`docs/INDEX.md` is the canonical index** — one row per doc: state · purpose (and the
  shipped version, if delivered). **Every file in `docs/` MUST have an INDEX row; a doc with
  no row is the rot signal.** Update it in the same changeset that adds or retires a doc.
- **Doc states:**
  - `REFERENCE` — documents current shipped behavior or architecture (e.g. `ARCHITECTURE.md`,
    the sf-ops gate, a shipped-engine spec, a live acceptance runbook).
  - `HONEST-ARTIFACT` — a published result that is part of the toolkit's credibility (e.g.
    the ceiling test). Preserved verbatim; a negative result is never edited away.
  - `ACTIVE` — a roadmap driving in-progress work.
  - `DESIGN` — a roadmap spec **not yet built**. MUST appear in `INDEX.md` so an unbuilt plan
    can never become an untracked half-done doc.
  - `DELIVERED vX.Y` — a roadmap whose work shipped. Kept as design-of-record (harness /
    acceptance file headers cite it by path), carries a `DELIVERED in vX.Y` banner, and is
    never mistaken for active work. Delivered roadmaps are **not** deleted and **not** moved
    without updating every file that cites them.
- **Every `roadmap-*.md` opens with a status header**: state, shipped-version (if any), and a
  build-order checklist — so each slice's completion is visible at a glance.
- **Honesty extends to docs (§2):** if a doc's thesis is later refuted by a published result,
  it MUST link the refutation. A doc may not present, unqualified, a claim the repo has
  falsified.
