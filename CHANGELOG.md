## [0.4.1] — 2026-06-15

WI-17 — the OSS external-surface scanners. The biggest coverage add: the
partner-hosted server tree + its IaC, which Code Analyzer never sees but
Salesforce explicitly pen-tests ("Test Your Entire Solution"), goes from
LLM-read + secret-scanned to mechanically **SAST'd, SCA'd, and IaC-scanned**.
All tools free/OSS. `run-scans` is now eight families.

### Added — two scan families + two extensions (all free/OSS)
- **Family 7 — External SAST:** **Semgrep** (multi-language keystone, custom-rule
  capable) + **Bandit**/**njsscan**/**gosec** per detected language, over every
  non-package source root.
- **Family 8 — External SCA + IaC:** **OSV-Scanner** (multi-ecosystem CVE scan of
  every external lockfile) + **Checkov** (Terraform/CloudFormation/K8s/Dockerfile
  misconfig); **Trivy** is a one-tool substitute.
- **Family 3 (DAST) extension:** **Nuclei** (community CVE/misconfig templates) +
  **Schemathesis** (OpenAPI-driven contract fuzzing, riding the OpenAPI artifact
  `generate-artifacts` already emits) + ZAP OpenAPI import.
- **Family 4 (TLS) extension:** **testssl.sh / sslyze** producing *local,
  deterministic* TLS evidence — the file that **satisfies
  `endpoint-ssl-labs-a-grade` deterministically and clears its `conflicting`
  status** (no reliance on a contested external letter grade).
- Three new baseline gates (`scan-external-sast`, `scan-external-sca`,
  `scan-iac-misconfig`, `applies_to: [external-endpoint]`, `major`) — they
  auto-flow into `applicableBaselineIds` and feed the SCI; a confirmed critical in
  reviewer-reachable server code is a fix-now blocker.

### Fixed
- `compute-sci.mjs` now **fails closed** on an empty/missing scope manifest
  (0 applicable requirements → `NOT READY`, not the prior fail-open
  `NO-SURPRISES READY`).

### Validated (on the seeded Helios fixture — extended with a vulnerable server
route, a CVE-bearing lockfile, a misconfigured Dockerfile + Terraform)
- Semgrep caught the OS command injection (`server/index.js`); OSV-Scanner caught
  14 GHSAs (lodash/minimist/express); Checkov caught the Terraform `0.0.0.0/0`
  security group + public-read S3 and the Dockerfile latest-tag + runs-as-root.
  The scan evidence registers into the evidence index → the three external-scan
  requirements read `SATISFIED` in the SCI; the SAST-found critical flows to the
  ledger → `BLOCKED`. Every probe proven by running the actual tool, not asserted.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-15

The **autonomous-orchestration extensions** spine (roadmap §3a, WI-20 + WI-18) —
the dependency root the rest of the 0.4.x work hangs off. Built and wired into the
existing journey so it fires with no manual step; the remaining extensions (WI-17
OSS external-surface scanners, WI-19 written-policy artifacts, WI-21 reviewer-sim,
WI-16 Checkmarx-predict, WI-22 path-to-green) are queued behind it. Provenance:
synthesized from the 2026-06-15 external-review pass (Gemini / ChatGPT / Claude
web), reconciled against the 0.3.1 dimension internals (most reviewer-flagged
code gaps were already covered — see the gap-audit §3a).

### Added — WI-20: the formal evidence model
- **`templates/evidence-index.schema.json`** — every readiness claim, scan family,
  generated artifact, and confirmed finding registers a typed evidence entry
  (`source`, `collected_by` agent/owner/scanner, `verified{value,how}`, `location`,
  `sha256`, `disposition`). Makes the toolkit's implicit HAVE-requires-evidence
  rule explicit data: a requirement is SATISFIED only with a registered, verified,
  on-disk file — no credit for un-evidenced self-attestation. `compile-submission`
  materializes the index from its artifact/evidence inventory.

### Added — WI-18: the Submission Completeness Index (SCI)
- **`harness/compute-sci.mjs`** — a deterministic, explainable readiness number
  that measures *materials + disposition completeness, never pass likelihood*
  (Salesforce pen-tests regardless). Pure rollup, no LLM, no learned weights, no
  network, no dependencies — same inputs yield byte-identical output. It reads the
  audit ledger + the evidence index + the scope-filtered baseline and emits a
  GATED block: a hard **blocker floor** (any open critical finding or unsatisfied
  `severity_if_missing: blocker` requirement → `BLOCKED`), over a 3-part vector
  (coverage `SATISFIED/PARTIAL/MISSING`, disposition of undispositioned
  critical/high, evidence freshness vs the 90-day window + `conflicting` baseline
  entries), a completeness % **explicitly labelled not-a-pass-prediction**, and the
  standing "NOT verified by this toolkit" list. Bands:
  `BLOCKED → NOT READY → MATERIALS COMPLETE → NO-SURPRISES READY`. Honesty by
  construction: never a naked single number, never the % without the gate and the
  not-verified list (CONVENTIONS §2; Claude-web's warning).

### Wired — autonomous orchestration
- `compile-submission` (Phase 5) writes the evidence index, runs `compute-sci`, and
  renders its block at the top of `readiness-verdict.md` and the readiness-tracker
  header (new `{{SUBMISSION_COMPLETENESS_INDEX_BLOCK}}` slot).
- `security-review-journey` surfaces the SCI as the **pre-compile go/no-go signal**:
  `BLOCKED`/`NOT READY` halts and names the blockers; `MATERIALS COMPLETE`/
  `NO-SURPRISES READY` proceeds.

### Validated
- Ran `compute-sci` against the 0.3.1 Helios acceptance run: correctly `BLOCKED`
  (14 open critical findings + 18 unsatisfied blocker requirements), coverage
  5/107 satisfied, disposition 14 critical / 39 high / 14 dispositioned, freshness
  flagged the 1 `conflicting` baseline entry (`endpoint-ssl-labs-a-grade`),
  completeness 5% — and byte-identical on re-run (deterministic).

## [0.3.1] — 2026-06-15

Acceptance-proven release. The 0.3.0 coverage dimensions were validated by a
fresh-context run against a fixture that actually *contains* their failure
classes — and that run found (and this release fixes) two engine-robustness gaps
and one verifier-guidance loophole that would have let a real partner run silently
under-report. The dimension *concepts* were sound; the gaps were all in the shared
engine and the verifier's refute rules.

### Added — the acceptance harness (`acceptance/`)
- **`generate-fixture.mjs`** — builds "Helios Service Agent", a synthetic
  Agentforce managed 2GP seeded with one concrete instance of every probe in the
  three 0.3.0 dimensions, negative controls, and a deleted-but-recoverable
  git-history secret. Synthetic secrets are assembled from parts at runtime so the
  generator itself stays secret-scan-clean; the fixture is regenerated on demand,
  never committed.
- **`expected-findings.md`** — the sealed ground-truth plant list (grading key),
  kept out of the fixture so finders cannot read it.
- **`build-run-args.mjs`** — mechanically performs the `audit-codebase` run-args
  step (extract §4 finder prompt + §5/§6 verifier guidance per dimension, inject a
  project-local engine), with a focused single-dimension re-run mode.
- **`acceptance-report-2026-06-15.md`** — the graded result: `apex-exposed-surface`
  8/8 planted classes, `package-metadata` 10/10, `agentforce-package` caught the
  VerifiedCustomerId/third-party-LLM/confirmation/invocable/LLM-output/logging/
  prompt-hardening classes, Family 6 recovered the deleted secret from history, and
  0 false positives on the 8 negative controls.

### Fixed — engine robustness (`harness/workflow-template.mjs`)
- **Finder repo-anchoring.** A finder could be derailed onto the current working
  directory's *foreign* `scope-manifest.json` (when the engine runs from another
  project's directory) and return "the codebase is not present" — a silent false
  "clean". The shared context now hard-anchors every finder and verifier to
  `REPO_ROOT`, forbids reading the cwd or any foreign manifest, and forbids an
  empty result on a "could-not-find-the-repo" basis. (Surfaced when one finder
  produced 0 findings on a fixture loaded with planted issues; with the fix it went
  0 → 19.)
- **Verifier now receives §5/§6.** The adversarial verifier previously saw only a
  generic "confirm only if the exploit is reachable in real code" prompt and never
  the dimension's own verifier guidance / false-positive patterns — so it
  over-refuted declaration-level metadata violations (exposed message channel,
  `http://`/wildcard trusted host, `position:absolute` in component CSS) on a "no
  live caller / dormant config" rationale the Salesforce static review does not
  apply. The engine now threads each dimension's §5+§6 as a `verifierNotes` run-arg
  and treats declaration-level violations as confirmed-on-declaration (reachability
  sets severity, not validity). Documented in the template header and the
  `audit-codebase` skill so a partner's run threads it too.

### Fixed — dimension verifier guidance (`agentforce-package.md` §5)
- **"Reachability first" no longer reads as license to refute.** A packaged
  `genAiPromptTemplate`/`GenAiFunction`/action that ships in the managed package is
  a reviewer-visible artifact even when not currently wired to a live agent. §5 now
  states that reachability sets *severity* (downgrade to low/info, verdict
  `partially_real`) and **never** issues `false_positive` on a "dead packaged code
  / not currently invoked" basis — closing the loophole by which the under-hardened
  prompt-template finding (AP7/8/9/12) was being dropped.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-15

Coverage-completeness release — the recall-defining structural work. A maintainer
coverage-gap audit mapped the toolkit against the *complete* AppExchange/AgentExchange
review surface (the baseline's `fail-*`/`violation-*`/`agentforce-*` corpus + the Top-20 +
the reviewer categories) and found the recall holes were **structural** — whole classes a
real reviewer catches that no dimension or scan family touched. This release closes the four
CRITICAL ones. Built multi-agent (author → adversarial-review, with a "specificity" gate so
every probe is a concrete imperative command, not a vague mention a finder could skip);
engine-wiring done by hand. Honesty posture unchanged: this raises *recall on the known
failure classes* — a no-surprises submission, never a guaranteed pass; Salesforce pen-tests
regardless.

### Added — three new audit dimensions (the toolkit now has 16)
- **`agentforce-package.md`** — the single largest gap closed. Audits the *packaged*
  Agentforce/AI surface (GenAiPlanner/Plugin/Function, prompt templates, Bot, invocable-Apex
  actions) **independent of whether an MCP server exists** — so a managed-package-only
  AgentExchange listing is no longer un-audited. Covers the BLOCKER auto-fail classes
  (`VerifiedCustomerId` scoping, user-controlled record refs, third-party-LLM-in-package),
  prompt-injection hardening, LLM-output-as-taint, action classification + per-action
  CRUD/FLS, confirmation-required, prompt/response logging.
- **`package-metadata.md`** — the metadata/XML violation class no code-AST dimension reads:
  Locker apiVersion <40, LMC `isExposed`, JS-in-Salesforce-domain (`onClickJavaScript`
  weblinks, `REQUIRESCRIPT`), CSS-isolation (`position:absolute/fixed`), static-resource
  hotlinking, open-redirect `PageReference`, CSRF `confirmationTokenRequired`,
  RemoteSiteSettings/CspTrustedSites inventory, sensitive-info-in-URL.
- **`apex-exposed-surface.md`** — the exposed-entry-point authorization surface Code
  Analyzer path-traces but doesn't reason about: `@AuraEnabled`/`@RestResource`/`webservice`/
  `@InvocableMethod`/`global`/guest-reachable Apex — should it be exposed? per-record/IDOR
  authz? over-exposure? (Complements, never duplicates, SFGE's structured CRUD/FLS dataflow.)

### Added — new scan family
- **`run-scans` Family 6 — Secret scan (working tree + full git history).** Closes the gap
  where the checklist *asserts* a secret-scan evidence file that nothing produced. Mechanical
  gitleaks/trufflehog over every source root + IaC paths AND full history (deleted-blob
  surfacing — the `git log --diff-filter=D` heuristic becomes a real tool invocation), gated
  on `fail-hardcoded-secrets`, backing `artifact-credential-storage-attestation`. Keeps the
  private-repo-history vs submitted-surface distinction + a rotation-evidence field, and
  states the mechanical-scanner ceiling (misses custom-format/low-entropy secrets — the
  `secrets-credentials` LLM finder is the standing complement).

### Wired
- `audit-methodology.md` §1.2 applicability matrix + §4.1 dimension→category table + §6
  pass-1 band; the "Packaged Apex is not a dimension" note reconciled (structured CRUD/FLS
  dataflow stays Code Analyzer; should-this-be-exposed/per-record-authz + metadata violations
  are now dimensions). `CONVENTIONS §8` repo layout. So the engine **auto-selects** the new
  dimensions on detection — a fresh skill-guided run includes them with no manual step.

### Notes
- Remaining roadmap: 0.2.2 quick-wins (Code-Analyzer engine-selection by element, RetireJS
  over static resources, Apex-test-coverage gate, injection-xss SOSL/open-redirect, ZAP
  error-hygiene/header probes, agentforce metadata-lint, compile-submission gates) + the
  HIGH/MEDIUM probes. Two cosmetic minors deferred (an inlined §4.1 subsection that restates
  the now-authoritative central table; one host-anchored grep seed).
- **Acceptance test pending:** a fresh-context run against a fixture containing a packaged
  Agentforce agent + LWC/Aura + Flows + a git-history secret, to prove the toolkit (not a
  clever operator) auto-fires the new dimensions.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-06-13

Fixes from the first **fresh-window end-to-end run** of the autonomous flow against
a from-scratch test fixture (a generic ISV repo the toolkit had never seen). The
run drove correctly through preflight → scope → audit-launch and the engine
self-recovered from the issue below, but these are the seams worth closing so the
next partner doesn't hit them.

### Fixed
- **`audit-codebase` engine launch is now robust, not just recoverable** (the #1
  fix). The launch step was ambiguous ("inject the placeholder *or* the runtime
  binds `args`"), which led to passing run-args via the Workflow `args` parameter
  — where they arrive as a JSON *string*, `args.repoRoot` is undefined, and the
  run fails fast with "run args missing or incomplete" (0 agents). The step is now
  unconditional: **always** copy the template to
  `<target>/.security-review/audit-engine.mjs`, replace the `INJECTED` placeholder
  with the JSON run-args, and run that copy via `scriptPath` — never the `args`
  param (which remains only a safety net). Mirrored in the template header.
- **`node --check` caveat documented.** The template's top-level `return {…}` is
  legal in the Workflow runtime's async scope but `node --check` reports it as an
  "Illegal return statement." Both `audit-codebase` and the template header now
  state this is expected and must not be "fixed" — to pre-check, `JSON.parse` only
  the injected object, not the whole module.
- **Deterministic applicable-count** (`scope-submission`): report the count as the
  exact length of the compiled `applicableBaselineIds` list, never an estimate; an
  "applicable" count exceeding the baseline total is a counting bug.
- **Baseline-currency ranking** (`security-review-journey` preflight): rank by the
  newest **non-null** `last_verified` (a `null` must never sort ahead of a real
  date — a naive `sort | tail` misreports a fresh baseline as stale), and report
  the verified-count + newest date separately from the unverified (null) count.

### Added
- **README "Running it hands-off (permissions)"** — a recommended read-only
  allowlist for `.claude/settings.json` (only non-destructive sensing; no writes,
  nothing live) and a note that the multi-agent audit runs smoothest with
  auto-accept on for the run's duration (some finder commands like
  `find … -exec grep` can't be covered by a prefix allowlist). The optional
  deployed-org deep audit and any live probe always pause for consent regardless.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-13

The autonomous release. The toolkit goes from a set of à-la-carte skills to a
single, fully-orchestrated autonomous flow: say "run the security review" and a
cheap preflight scan reports what it found, what it actually needs, and what
optional power-ups apply — then it runs the whole journey to a complete,
downloadable submission package, pausing only at genuine safety gates. Built by
multi-agent authoring with an adversarial-review pass on every component, then
fixed and re-verified. The honesty posture is unchanged and non-negotiable: it is
read-only on your source and never claims you "will pass."

### Added
- **Autonomous, preflight-gated orchestrator** (`security-review-journey`,
  rewritten from router to driver). A universal preflight detects architecture
  (and reads the Dev Hub when `sf` is authed), emits a three-tier report
  (✓ detected · ⚠ audit-blocking needs · ✦ optional power-ups), then drives
  scope → audit → artifacts → scans → compile autonomously. The only hard stops
  are an audit-blocking missing input and consent before touching anything live;
  open critical/high findings halt-and-report by default (continue-with-flags is
  an explicit operator election). Broadened triggers so natural phrasings
  activate it; router/"where are we" behavior preserved.
- **Dev Hub auto-resolution** in `scope-submission`: with an operator-consented
  `sf` connection it auto-answers ~a dozen inputs from the Tooling API
  (released/coverage/validation-skipped, `IsSecurityReviewed`, the
  RemoteSiteSettings + CspTrustedSites external-endpoint inventory that becomes
  the DAST target list, the permission matrix, Named/External-Credential
  topology, test-org security posture) into `sf-autoresolve.json` — with a
  `describeSObject`-first guardrail. Submission/business acts stay
  Partner-Console-only. Adds a listing-direction (A/B) classifier that branches
  the MCP auth rules (outbound `client_credentials`-OK vs inbound ECA+PKCE).
- **Submission-package assembler** in `compile-submission`: assembles
  `docs/security-review/submission-package/` with an `INDEX.md` mapping every
  artifact to its exact Security Review Wizard step + upload slot, a
  `PENDING-OWNER-RUN.md` handoff, and conditional slot suppression (no empty
  Desktop/Mobile slots).
- **Eight-category report spine** (authN/session · authZ CRUD-FLS+sharing ·
  input-validation · output-encoding · crypto · comms-security · logging/error ·
  secrets-storage) across the audit report, and **agent/ForcedLeak detectors**
  in the MCP threat-model dimension (output-egress allowlist, stale/expired
  allowlisted-domain exfil, untrusted-CRM-text-as-instructions).
- **Optional `sf`-CLI-gated deployed-org deep audit** — five lifecycle skills
  brought in and adapted (à-la-carte → orchestrated): `bootstrap-cli-auth`,
  `build-managed-package`, `install-and-verify-package`,
  `teardown-mcp-registration`, and the new `audit-deployed-package`. They stand
  the package up in a throwaway org and audit the *deployed* artifact (the
  reviewer's own test): least-privilege grants as a subscriber gets them
  (including install-time UEC grant-drop verification), Graph-Engine CRUD/FLS on
  the installed package, callout resolution, and install+uninstall integrity.
  Self-contained (no runtime dependency on any other plugin); the four reused
  skills were authored by this toolkit's author and contributed to
  `mvogelgesang/sf-mcp-partner-toolkit` — attributed in the new `CREDITS.md`.

### Notes
- Validated end to end by a fresh-context run against a real production codebase
  on 2026-06-13 (see Status in the README).
- Honesty/genericization guardrails enforced: the public repo carries no
  references to private design/research docs, no perishable fee literals (the
  fee lives in the baseline), and the leakage sweep is clean.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-13

First fine-tuning pass driven by a **fresh-context end-to-end validation run**: the
toolkit was executed cold against a real production codebase (a multi-tenant FastAPI +
Postgres row-level-security backend with an OAuth 2.1 authorization server, a partner-
hosted MCP server, and two thin 2GP managed packages — a Canvas-on-ECA embed and an MCP
registration package). The audit engine performed well — from an empty ledger it
re-discovered every known-open finding, refuted 4 of 9 candidate findings against the
source with precise code evidence (zero unverified), did not re-confirm a single
already-fixed item, and surfaced real findings a prior hand-built audit had under-rated;
the generated artifact pack matched a hand-built reference pack on substance and exceeded
it on honest open-gap flagging and tool-count reconciliation. The changes below are the
refinements that validation surfaced.

### Changed
- **scope-submission: the manifest's `package` block is now `packages[]` (an array).**
  An AgentExchange MCP listing commonly ships **two** packages — a thin MCP-registration
  package (ESR + External/Named Credential + permission set) *and* a separate Canvas/UI
  embed package — which the previous single-`package` schema could not represent. The
  step-7 schema example and the surrounding prose now record each detected package as its
  own entry.
- **scope-submission: `canvas` added to the endpoint `role` enum** in the manifest schema
  example (was `mcp | identity | web-app | api`), since Canvas is a first-class scoped
  element with its own audit dimension.
- **secrets-credentials dimension: sharper review-gating guidance on git-history secrets.**
  A committed production secret is always a critical, rotate-now item — but the report must
  distinguish *security* from *review-gating*: a secret in the partner's **private source
  repo history** is a breach item the Salesforce reviewer does **not** scan for (the review
  reads the submitted package, the live endpoints, and the docs — not the partner's repo),
  whereas a secret in the **submitted package** or reviewer-reachable code is also a
  guaranteed flagged finding. Rotate either way; only frame a finding as
  "submission-blocking because the reviewer will catch it" when the secret is in the
  submitted surface. This keeps the report precise without softening the rotation imperative.

### Notes
- No engine, schema-of-findings, or skill-contract changes — re-running the audit against
  the same codebase reproduces the same findings (convergent). These are documentation and
  manifest-shape refinements.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-12

Initial release. Eight skills (security-review-journey orchestrator + scope-submission,
audit-codebase, generate-artifacts, run-scans, prepare-test-environment,
compile-submission, stay-listed), 13 audit dimensions, 9 artifact templates, the
multi-agent audit workflow harness + authenticated-DAST (ZAP) plan generator, and the
baseline-as-data requirement map. Apache-2.0.
