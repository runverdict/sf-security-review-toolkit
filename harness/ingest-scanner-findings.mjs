 * ingest-scanner-findings.mjs — turn DETERMINISTIC scanner / metadata output into
 * provenance-tagged `deterministic` audit-ledger findings (Phase 1 · Slice 1 of
 * docs/roadmap-deterministic-findings.md — the ingest foundation).
 *
 * WHY this exists. A 5-run cold campaign proved the LLM-generated blocker band is
 * unstable run-to-run (CRUD/FLS findings flickered high·high·ABSENT·high·high). Yet
 * Code Analyzer (PMD/SFGE) finds those exact bugs DETERMINISTICALLY every run — its
 * output just never reached the ledger. This engine is that missing path: a scanner
 * finding becomes a ledger finding with provenance:'deterministic', the engine +
 * ruleId that fired, and a severity taken from the REQUIREMENT CLASS (not the LLM,
 * and not the scanner's own 1-5 number). The LLM stops being the source of truth for
 * anything an engine already determined.
 *
 * PLUGGABLE ADAPTER REGISTRY (so Semgrep / OSV / gitleaks / Checkov land as a new
 * adapter object, never a rewrite). Every adapter is the SAME shape:
 *
 *   { name, kind, collect({input,target}) -> raw|null, parse(raw) -> hits[], classify(ruleId) -> classKey|null }
 *
 * Two adapter KINDS, both shipped in Slice 1 to prove the seam handles N>1 and both:
 *   - file-parser   — collect() reads a scanner's CAPTURED output file (--input).
 *                     Adapter #1: `code-analyzer` (PMD + SFGE violations JSON).
 *                     Adapter #3 (Phase 2 · 2a #1): `checkov` (IaC-misconfig JSON; engine:'checkov').
 *                     Adapter #4 (Phase 2 · 2a #2): `semgrep` (multi-language SAST JSON;
 *                       engine:'semgrep') — the FIRST tool→band adapter (severity from the
 *                       tool's own ERROR/WARNING/INFO, owns no toolkit class).
 *                     Adapter #5 (Phase 2 · 2a #3): `bandit` (Python SAST JSON; engine:'bandit')
 *                       — the SECOND tool→band adapter, the proof the Semgrep tool→band path
 *                       GENERALIZES (severity from HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW, owns no class, NO harness change).
 *                     Adapter #6 (Phase 2 · 2a #4): `njsscan` (Node SAST JSON; engine:'njsscan')
 *                       — the THIRD tool→band adapter (severity from ERROR/WARNING/INFO, owns no
 *                       class, NO harness change), the FIRST with a DIFFERENT input shape: a nested
 *                       object `{nodejs:{…},templates:{…}}` keyed by rule_id, NOT a flat results[].
 *                     Adapter #7 (Phase 2 · 2a #5): `gitleaks` (hardcoded-secrets JSON;
 *                       engine:'gitleaks') — a DESIGN PIVOT BACK to CLASS-severity (like checkov, NOT
 *                       tool→band): a secret carries no tool-severity tier, so severity comes from the
 *                       `fail-hardcoded-secrets` CLASS (major → high). UNIQUE in two ways: (1) it owns a
 *                       class AND a REAL methodology dimension (`secrets-credentials`), so it SUPERSEDES
 *                       a co-located LLM secrets finding — the first adapter to enforce "the LLM does not
 *                       re-report what the scanner determined" for its class; (2) gitleaks output carries
 *                       the LIVE secret (Match/Secret) plus commit PII (Author/Email/Message), so the
 *                       adapter is built to emit a finding from ONLY non-sensitive fields and NEVER pass
 *                       any of those downstream (§3 of the slice — the secret-never-leaks invariant).
 *                     Adapter #8 (Phase 2 · 2a #6): `detect-secrets` (hardcoded-secrets JSON;
 *                       engine:'detect-secrets') — the secrets SIBLING of gitleaks. It REUSES the
 *                       `hardcoded-secrets` class (NO new CLASS_DEFS entry, NO buildFinding change): a
 *                       class-severity adapter, severity from `fail-hardcoded-secrets` (major → high). Two
 *                       new things only: (a) detect-secrets' OWN nested-object JSON `{results:{<file>:[…]}}`
 *                       keyed by FILE (NOT gitleaks' flat array), so its own `parse`; (b) it carries a
 *                       `hashed_secret` (a SHA) and, under `--show-secrets`, could carry plaintext — the
 *                       same secret-never-leaks invariant applies (emit ONLY `type`/file/`line_number`,
 *                       never the hash or plaintext). With TWO secrets engines now live, the same secret at
 *                       one locus produces TWO deterministic ledger rows — visible, the SAFE under-merge;
 *                       collapsing them is cross-engine dedup = §10 extension #3 (Phase-2b), NOT this slice.
 *                     Adapter #9 (Phase 2 · 2a #7): `osv` (dependency-CVE / SCA JSON; engine:'osv') — the
 *                       SEVENTH §10 adapter and **Extension A: the CVSS→enum severity fork**. A dep CVE
 *                       carries a REAL CVSS base score, while the only CLASS severity (scan-external-sca =
 *                       major) is a *missing-scan* GATE severity — so the per-FINDING band is PER-ADVISORY
 *                       (`severityKind:'advisory'`), resolved from the advisory's CVSS via
 *                       CVSS_SCORE_TO_FINDING, and the class governs ONLY the gate. It REUSES the
 *                       `bandFromTool` path EXACTLY like semgrep/bandit/njsscan (the band SOURCE is the only
 *                       difference: CVSS, not a tool tier), so the ONLY shared-code change is the additive
 *                       `gateLabel` parameter in buildFinding (whose default preserves the SAST output
 *                       byte-for-byte). Severity priority per vuln: numeric group `max_severity` → the vuln's
 *                       `database_specific.severity` LABEL → `medium` (a known CVE of unknown severity is
 *                       still real). dep-CVEs have no file:line (locus = the lockfile/package); classify()→null
 *                       so it owns no class and supersedes nothing (cross-engine dedup with npm/Trivy = §10
 *                       extension #3, Phase-2b).
 *                     Adapter #10 (Phase 2 · 2a #8): `npm-audit` (Node dependency-CVE JSON; engine:'npm-audit') —
 *                       the EASY Extension-A REUSE. `npm audit --json` (auditReportVersion 2) gives a DIRECT
 *                       severity LABEL per vulnerable package (`critical/high/moderate/low/info`) — no CVSS math —
 *                       so the band comes straight from NPM_SEVERITY_TO_FINDING, exactly like OSV's label-fallback
 *                       path. It REUSES the `bandFromTool` path, the `gateLabel` param, the `dependency-cve`
 *                       dimension, and classify()→null EXACTLY like OSV — so there is NO buildFinding/CLASS_DEFS
 *                       change (gateLabel already exists), only the ADAPTERS registry line. It is gated by
 *                       `scan-dependency-vulnerabilities` (applies_to all, major — the npm-deps gate, distinct from
 *                       OSV's scan-external-sca). One finding per vulnerable package (npm keys by package); `via`
 *                       supplies the advisory title/url (a STRING via-entry is a transitive chain, an OBJECT via-
 *                       entry is the direct advisory). Unknown/blank severity → medium (judgment call, as OSV).
 *                       With two dep-CVE engines now live, OSV+npm-audit can flag the SAME CVE — the duplicate is
 *                       visible (the SAFE under-merge); collapsing it is §10 extension #3 (Phase-2b).
 *                     Adapter #11 (Phase 2 · 2a #9): `trivy` (IaC-misconfig JSON; engine:'trivy') — the multi-mode
 *                       scanner, done CONFIG-mode only this slice (the only mode with a captured fixture). A Trivy
 *                       `Class:'config'` finding is the SAME vuln class as Checkov, so it REUSES the `iac-misconfig`
 *                       class (NO new CLASS_DEFS, NO buildFinding change — like detect-secrets reused
 *                       `hardcoded-secrets`): a CLASS-severity adapter at class `high`, NOT a tool→band path. The
 *                       parse is CLASS-DISPATCH (forward-compatible): it handles `Class:'config'` now and SKIPS the
 *                       vuln (os-pkgs/lang-pkgs) and `secret` classes (Phase-2b — no fixtures yet). CONSISTENCY CALL:
 *                       Trivy DOES carry a per-misconfig Severity, but for the same class to be consistent across
 *                       engines it lands at class-severity exactly like Checkov (its Severity recorded in the message
 *                       for reference, never moving the band) — a per-tool-severity refinement for `iac-misconfig`
 *                       (Checkov + Trivy both) is the same Phase-2b item flagged at Checkov. Trivy + Checkov flag the
 *                       SAME Dockerfile misconfig (DS-0026 ↔ CKV_DOCKER_2) → two visible rows; collapsing = §10 ext #3.
 *                     Adapter #12 (residual-shrinking · B5 #1): `regexploit` (ReDoS / catastrophic-
 *                       backtracking-regex TEXT output; engine:'regexploit') — the FIRST format-C
 *                       (non-JSON) adapter. regexploit emits human-readable text ONLY (its output/
 *                       text.py is the package's only writer — no JSON/JSONL exists), so the evidence
 *                       file is the tool's VERBATIM stdout (evidence/redos-<date>.txt), this adapter
 *                       parses that format, and `--all` (which enumerates evidence/*.json and
 *                       JSON-parses each) does NOT auto-recognize it — a DOCUMENTED limitation that
 *                       beats a lossy wrapper format; the explicit `--scanner regexploit --input`
 *                       path ingests it. `detect(raw)` matches only the raw TEXT shape (a string
 *                       carrying the tool's own markers) and is an honest false for every parsed-JSON
 *                       shape. Tool→band via REDOS_DEGREE_TO_FINDING (exponential → high; polynomial
 *                       degrees → medium; unknown → medium) — NEVER critical/blocker from the tool
 *                       alone: the scanner proves the PATTERN is catastrophic, and whether attacker-
 *                       controlled input REACHES it is the reachability residual (the semgrep
 *                       ERROR→high ceiling precedent). classify()→null — see the adapter comment for
 *                       WHY owning a class here would be a correctness hazard (resource-consumption-
 *                       abuse is a MULTI-SHAPE dimension). Gated by `resource-consumption-abuse`
 *                       (the RCA baseline id, major — the osv gateLabel-param precedent).
 *   - source-scanner — collect() greps the repo source directly (no external tool).
 *                     Adapter #2: `metadata-viewall` (engine:'metadata') — scans
 *                     permissionsets/*.permissionset-meta.xml for ViewAll/ModifyAll
 *                     over-grants, the one class Code Analyzer doesn't cover (it's
 *                     permission-set XML, not Apex).
 *
 * The core `ingest(raw, adapter, {repoRoot, pass})` is PURE (no Date / Math.random /
 * network; byte-deterministic given `raw`) — `collect()` is the only I/O seam, so the
 * standing test drives `ingest` on in-memory fixtures. Re-ingesting the same scanner
 * output is idempotent: a deterministic finding's id is stable from engine+ruleId+file:line,
 * so the merge dedups it (no duplicates).
 *
 * SCOPE: ingest + a Security/AppExchange TAG FILTER (Slice 2) — the three wobbled
 * classes (CRUD/FLS, sharing, ViewAll/ModifyAll) get provenance + class-severity, and a
 * MAPPED finding also carries its toolkit `class` (the owned-class label the supersession
 * engine reads). Only a Security/AppExchange-tagged Code Analyzer rule becomes a finding
 * (raw CA output is dominated by ApexDoc/naming/codestyle/Performance noise) — this is a
 * filter on non-security NOISE, NOT a drop of a security finding: an unmapped *security*
 * rule is still ingested as deterministic (never silently dropped) with the documented
 * Code-Analyzer-severity fallback. LLM-supersession ENFORCEMENT (a deterministic finding
 * supersedes a co-located same-class LLM finding) lives in its own pure engine,
 * harness/reconcile-provenance.mjs (Slice 2); journey re-sequencing is Slice 3.
 *
 * Read-only on partner source except the ledger it merges into
 * (<target>/.security-review/audit-ledger.json).

 *     by CONTENT SHAPE (never filename) and ingests each into the deterministic band in one
 *     pass. Mutually exclusive with --scanner (the per-scanner dispatch is untouched). This is
 *     what the audit Step 4 and the run-scans tail invoke so a cold run actually ingests the
 *     full OSS scanner set, not just code-analyzer + metadata.

// The three wobbled classes Slice 1 re-homes onto the scanners. Each carries the

//   viewall-overgrant grounds its severity in fail-sharing-model because a ViewAll/
//   ModifyAll over-grant IS a sharing-rules bypass (official taxonomy + the Solano C5
//   adjudication: "viewAllRecords=true ... a sharing bypass", HIGH floor).
//   iac-misconfig (Phase 2 · adapter 2a #1, Checkov) grounds its severity in scan-iac-misconfig
//   (severity_if_missing: major → high). Its `dimension` 'infrastructure-iac' is a
//   DETERMINISTIC-ONLY grouping label: IaC misconfig is fully deterministic (Checkov/Trivy),
//   so it has NO LLM finder dimension and deliberately NO methodology/dimensions/ file — the
//   schema declares `dimension` a free kebab-case string (not an enum), and nothing validates a
//   finding's dimension against the methodology-file set, so this label needs no dimension doc.
//   hardcoded-secrets (Phase 2 · adapter 2a #5, gitleaks) grounds its severity in
//   fail-hardcoded-secrets (severity_if_missing: major → high). UNLIKE iac-misconfig's
//   deterministic-only label, its `dimension` 'secrets-credentials' is a REAL methodology
//   dimension (methodology/dimensions/secrets-credentials.md — it owns secret custody), so a
//   gitleaks finding OWNS a class AND a real dimension and therefore SUPERSEDES a co-located LLM
//   secrets-credentials finding (reconcile-provenance reads the owned class, falling back to the
//   dimension when the LLM finding carries no class). This is the same real-dimension pattern as
//   crud-fls→apex-exposed-surface, NOT the deterministic-only external-sast label — gitleaks maps
//   cleanly to one dimension, so it uses the real one. The bounded over-supersede risk (a DIFFERENT

// co-located LLM `secrets-credentials` finding. The ONLY shared-file touch is the `ADAPTERS` registry line.
// TWO things make it distinct from gitleaks:
//   (1) detect-secrets' OWN nested-object JSON: `{ results: { <file>: [occurrence, …] } }` — `results` is an
//       OBJECT keyed by FILE (each value an array of occurrences), NOT gitleaks' flat top-level ARRAY. Hence
//       its own `parse` that iterates the file keys then each occurrence; no harness-core change.
//   (2) with TWO secrets engines now live, the same secret at one locus produces TWO deterministic ledger
//       rows (one per engine). `reconcile-provenance` does NOT collapse them — it only supersedes an
//       `llm-inferred` finding, and a deterministic finding never supersedes another deterministic finding —
//       so the cross-engine duplicate is VISIBLE (the SAFE under-merge — no engine silently hides another's
//       finding). Collapsing gitleaks↔detect-secrets↔njsscan `node_secret` is cross-engine dedup = §10
//       extension #3 (Phase-2b), NOT this slice. (detect-secrets DOES still supersede a co-located *LLM*
//       secrets finding — that part is wired via the shared `hardcoded-secrets` class, same as gitleaks.)
// THE SECRET/HASH-NEVER-LEAKS INVARIANT (same as gitleaks). A detect-secrets occurrence carries a
// `hashed_secret` (a SHA of the secret — leak-safe by detect-secrets' design) and, if scanned with
// `--show-secrets`, could carry plaintext. The adapter builds each hit from ONLY `type`, the file path, and
// `line_number`, and DELIBERATELY never passes `hashed_secret` (or any plaintext field) into ANY finding
// field; `message` names the `type` only — never the hash. (`buildFinding`'s `redact()` is a defense-in-

// ADAPTER #9 — osv (file-parser, Phase 2 · 2a #7): parses captured OSV-Scanner JSON.
// OSV-Scanner is the toolkit's dependency-CVE / SCA scanner (run-scans Family 8, over every lockfile —
// requirements.txt / package-lock.json / go.sum / … — under a non-package source root). It is the SEVENTH
// §10 adapter and forces **Extension A: the CVSS→enum severity fork**: unlike the SAST family (tool tier
// ERROR/WARNING/INFO → band) and the class-severity adapters (checkov/secrets → class), a dep CVE carries a
// REAL CVSS base score, while the only CLASS severity (scan-external-sca = major) is a *missing-scan* GATE
// severity. So the per-FINDING band is PER-ADVISORY (`severityKind:'advisory'`) — resolved from the
// advisory's CVSS via CVSS_SCORE_TO_FINDING — and the class governs ONLY the gate (carried as
// `gateLabel:'scan-external-sca'` on each hit). It REUSES buildFinding's `bandFromTool` path EXACTLY like
// semgrep/bandit/njsscan (classify()→null, no securityRelevant, a dimensionHint, severityNum:null) — the
// band SOURCE is the only difference (CVSS, not a tool tier) — so the ONLY shared-code change is the additive
// `gateLabel` parameter in buildFinding (whose default preserves the SAST adapters' output byte-for-byte).
//
// SEVERITY PRIORITY per vulnerability: (1) the numeric `max_severity` of the package `group` that contains
// this vuln id → CVSS_SCORE_TO_FINDING (an enum band); (2) else the vuln's `database_specific.severity`
// LABEL → OSV_LABEL_TO_FINDING; (3) else `'medium'` — a known CVE of unknown severity is still a real
// finding, and the conservative middle (NOT info, NOT the gate's high) is the honest call.
//
// THREE judgment calls (documented in the CHANGELOG + roadmap):
//   1. Unscored CVE → `medium` (not info, not the gate's high) — over/under-stating an unknown-severity CVE
//      is dishonest; the conservative middle is the faithful call.
//   2. No file:line — a dep CVE locates to the lockfile/package, not a code line; `file` = the lockfile
//      source path (or `ecosystem:name` when OSV gives no source), `startLine:null`. Two vulns of one
//      package = distinct ids (distinct GHSA/CVE); the SAME CVE under two lockfiles = distinct loci (distinct
//      `file`) — correct, those are two real install sites.
//   3. `classify()`→null, owns no class, supersedes nothing — there is no LLM dependency-CVE finder to
//      supersede; OSV findings only populate the band. Cross-engine dedup with npm-audit/Trivy on the SAME
//      CVE is §10 extension #3 (Phase-2b), NOT this slice.
//

// adapter and the EASY **Extension-A REUSE**: `auditReportVersion:2` gives a DIRECT severity LABEL per vulnerable
// package (`critical/high/moderate/low/info`) — NO CVSS parsing — so the band comes straight from
// NPM_SEVERITY_TO_FINDING, exactly like OSV's label-fallback path. It REUSES buildFinding's `bandFromTool` path
// EXACTLY like OSV (classify()→null, no securityRelevant, severityNum:null, dimensionHint 'dependency-cve',
// gateLabel) — the band SOURCE (an npm label, not a CVSS) is the only difference — so there is NO buildFinding /
// CLASS_DEFS change (gateLabel already exists since OSV/0.8.37); the ONLY shared-file touch is the ADAPTERS line.
//
// FOUR judgment calls (documented in the CHANGELOG + roadmap):
//   1. Unknown/blank severity → `medium` (not info, not the gate's high) — consistent with OSV's unscored-CVE rule:
//      a known CVE of unknown severity is real, and the conservative middle is the honest call.
//   2. ONE finding per vulnerable package — npm's `vulnerabilities` map is keyed by package, and its `severity` is
//      that package's MAX advisory severity. `via` supplies the advisory title/url: a `via[i]` that is a STRING is a
//      transitive package name ("vulnerable via that one"); a `via[i]` that is an OBJECT is a direct advisory
//      (`{source,name,title,url,severity,cwe,cvss,range}`). The first OBJECT via-entry is the advisory; string
//      via-entries form the "vulnerable via …" chain. `ruleId` prefers the advisory URL/id, else the package name.
//      NOTE: the band uses the PACKAGE severity (`e.severity`, the max), NOT the first advisory's own severity — so
//      `qs` (package `moderate`, first advisory `low`) bands as medium, not low.
//   3. `gateLabel:'scan-dependency-vulnerabilities'` (the npm-deps gate, applies_to all, major) — DISTINCT from
//      OSV's `scan-external-sca`; both major. npm-audit findings say "gated by scan-dependency-vulnerabilities".
//   4. `classify()`→null, owns no class, supersedes nothing — there is no LLM dependency-CVE finder to supersede;
//      npm-audit findings only populate the band. Cross-engine dedup with OSV/Trivy on the SAME CVE (now even more
//      concrete with two dep-CVE engines — the duplicate is visible, the SAFE under-merge) is §10 extension #3
//      (Phase-2b), NOT this slice.
//
// No file:line — npm-audit gives no source path, so `file` is the lockfile (`package-lock.json`) and
// `startLine:null`. The raw CVSS vector that a direct advisory MAY carry (`via[i].cvss.vectorString`) is
// DELIBERATELY never read into any field (only the advisory title/url are) — the band is the npm label.
// dimension 'dependency-cve' is the same DETERMINISTIC-ONLY grouping label OSV uses (no LLM dep finder → no

// ADAPTER #11 — trivy (file-parser, Phase 2 · 2a #9): parses captured Trivy JSON (CONFIG / IaC-misconfig mode).
// Trivy is the toolkit's multi-mode scanner (run-scans: IaC-misconfig over Dockerfile/Terraform/K8s, plus
// os-pkgs/lang-pkgs SCA and a secret mode). THIS slice does exactly ONE mode — `Class:'config'` (IaC misconfig) —
// because that is the only mode with a REAL captured fixture on disk, and that mode is the SAME vuln class as
// Checkov, so trivy REUSES the `iac-misconfig` class (NO new `CLASS_DEFS` entry, NO `buildFinding` change — like
// detect-secrets reused `hardcoded-secrets`): a CLASS-severity adapter, severity from the `iac-misconfig` CLASS
// (scan-iac-misconfig = major → high) via a CONSTANT `classify()`→`'iac-misconfig'`, NO tag filter
// (security-by-construction, like checkov/metadata). The ONLY shared-file touch is the `ADAPTERS` registry line.
//
// THE PARSE IS CLASS-DISPATCH (forward-compatible). Trivy's `Results[]` each carry a `Class`: `'config'`
// (IaC misconfig), `'os-pkgs'`/`'lang-pkgs'` (a dependency-CVE/SCA list — would reuse Extension A's
// `dependency-cve` band), or `'secret'` (would reuse the `hardcoded-secrets` class). THIS slice handles ONLY
// `Class:'config'` and SKIPS the vuln/secret classes — those are **Phase-2b** (no captured fixtures yet) — so the
// parse is forward-compatible: when a future slice ships the SCA/secret fixtures, the dispatch grows a branch and
// nothing already-shipped changes. Only `Status:'FAIL'` misconfigurations become findings (a `PASS` is a satisfied
// check, not a finding).
//
// THREE judgment calls (documented in the CHANGELOG + roadmap):
//   1. **Class-severity, CONSISTENT WITH CHECKOV** — Trivy DOES carry a per-misconfig `Severity`
//      (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL), but Checkov (the OTHER `iac-misconfig` engine) lands EVERY IaC misconfig at the
//      class `high`. For the same toolkit class to be consistent across engines, Trivy ALSO uses class-severity:
//      the misconfig's `Severity` is recorded in the message *for reference* (mirroring how Checkov records its
//      absent tool severity), but it does NOT move the band — a `Severity:'LOW'` misconfig is STILL `high`, exactly
//      like Checkov. A per-misconfig-tool-severity refinement for the `iac-misconfig` class (Checkov + Trivy both)
//      stays the SAME Phase-2b item flagged at Checkov — this slice introduces NO tool→band path for IaC. (Hence
//      `severityNum:null`, no `bandFromTool`: the mapped class-severity branch governs, the tool number never reaches it.)
//   2. **Config mode only this slice** — the vuln (os-pkgs/lang-pkgs) and secret classes are skipped (Phase-2b),
//      so there is no fabricated SCA/secret finding from a Trivy run; the dispatch is forward-compatible.
//   3. **Cross-engine dedup now concrete for IaC too** — Trivy + Checkov both flag the SAME Dockerfile misconfig
//      (Trivy `DS-0026` "No HEALTHCHECK" ↔ Checkov `CKV_DOCKER_2`) → TWO `iac-misconfig` rows. Neither supersedes
//      the other (both deterministic; a deterministic finding never supersedes another), so the duplicate is
//      VISIBLE — the SAFE under-merge; collapsing it is roadmap §10 extension #3 (Phase-2b), NOT this slice.
//

// ADAPTER #12 — regexploit (file-parser, residual-shrinking · B5 #1): parses captured regexploit
// TEXT output (ReDoS / catastrophic-backtracking regex — CWE-1333). regexploit is the toolkit's ReDoS
// scanner (run-scans Family 7 leg: `regexploit-py` / `regexploit-js` over every detected non-package
// language root; pip package `regexploit`, exit 0 whether or not vulnerable patterns are found). It
// moves the catastrophic-regex *pattern* substrate of the `resource-consumption-abuse` dimension from
// LLM-inferred to deterministic — the baseline entry's own automation note ("catastrophic regex
// patterns are statically detectable") made true — leaving REACHABILITY as the labelled residual.
//
// FORMAT C — the FIRST non-JSON adapter. regexploit emits human-readable TEXT only (the package's
// output/text.py is its only writer; no JSON/JSONL output exists, and the npm `recheck` alternative
// ships no repo-scanning bin at all), so:
//   - the evidence file is the tool's VERBATIM stdout (evidence/redos-<date>.txt) — never a wrapper
//     format that re-writes tool output;
//   - `collect()` reads the input as TEXT (no JSON.parse) and `parse()` parses the tool's own format;
//   - `detect(raw)` matches ONLY the raw TEXT shape (a string carrying the tool's own markers) and is
//     an honest `false` for every parsed-JSON shape — so `--all` (which enumerates evidence/*.json
//     and JSON-parses each) does NOT auto-recognize regexploit evidence. DOCUMENTED limitation, not a
//     bug: the explicit `--scanner regexploit --input <redos.txt>` path is the ingest route (run-scans
//     Family 7 narrates it). A text fixture still proves detect-disjointness: every existing detect
//     requires an object/array shape, so a string can never be ambiguous with them.
//
// THE PARSE (regexploit's own format, per its output/text.py):
//   Vulnerable regex in <file> #<lineno>      ← one BLOCK per vulnerable regex; #<lineno> is the
//   Pattern: <regex>                            source line (absent for stdin scans → startLine null)
//   Context: <source line>                    ← optional (the JS scanner omits it)
//   ---
//   Redos(starriness=N, …)                    ← one or MORE records per block (one per ambiguous
//   Worst-case complexity: N ⭐… (<degree>)     subsequence); the block's band is the WORST record
//   …                                           (max starriness — exponential=11 always beats
//   Example: …                                  polynomial ≤ 10)
// Trailer lines ("Processed N regexes", parser errors) are ignored. ONE finding per block: file:line
// + pattern IS the vulnerable regex; two blocks of the same pattern at distinct lines are distinct
// findings (distinct loci).
//
// TOOL→BAND via REDOS_DEGREE_TO_FINDING (exponential → high · polynomial → medium · unknown →
// medium), gated by `resource-consumption-abuse` (the RCA baseline id, major — the osv gateLabel-param
// precedent, NOT the scan-external-sast default). NEVER critical/blocker from the tool alone —
// reachability is the residual (the semgrep ERROR→high ceiling precedent).
//
// THE DESIGN DECISION — classify() is the CONSTANT null: this adapter owns NO class and supersedes
// NOTHING (the semgrep/bandit precedent, NOT the gitleaks one). WHY, from the code:
// reconcile-provenance.mjs::sameOwnedClass falls back to a DIMENSION match when the LLM finding
// carries no explicit class (the realistic case) — and `resource-consumption-abuse` is a MULTI-SHAPE
// dimension (unrestricted consumption / denial-of-wallet / algorithmic amplification). A class-owning
// deterministic ReDoS finding at api/server.py would therefore supersede a co-located LLM
// missing-rate-limit or denial-of-wallet finding in the same file — a real correctness hazard.
// gitleaks could own its class safely ONLY because secrets-credentials is single-shape. So the
// deterministic ReDoS row sits BESIDE, never silences, the dimension's other findings; two rows for
// the same regex (one deterministic, one pre-existing LLM) is the documented SAFE under-merge, and
// cross-engine dedup stays §10 extension #3 (Phase-2b). The B1 ordering (static substrate BEFORE the
// LLM fan-out + the ledger digest compiled AFTER the deterministic pass) already prevents duplicate
// find-time work. Locked by the RD-non-supersession standing test (mutation-proven: a classify() that
// returns an owned class turns that test RED).
//
// `ruleId` is a deterministic derivation from the pattern (regexploit has no rule ids):
// `redos-<sha16(pattern)>` — stable across runs, no timestamps. The pattern itself IS source code
// (regexploit prints Pattern/Context from the scanned code, never runtime user data), so it appears
// in the message; the hash keeps the ruleId flat. Like the other scanners it is SECURITY-BY-
// CONSTRUCTION (every reported block is an ambiguous regex), so NO `securityRelevant`.
